### Changes to binary trees

* Binary trees now have two parameters, the first being the type of node labels, and the second being the type of leaf labels.
* **Changes Required**
Instead of using `Tree A` from `Data.Tree.Binary`, you now must use `Tree A ⊤` to get the same functionality.

`map` now requires a function on both nodes and leaves. There are also `mapₙ` and `mapₗ` which only map on nodes and leaves respectively. There are similar changes for `Data.Tree.Relation.Unary.All`.

Other major changes

Other minor additions
---------------------

* Added the decidablitity functions `_<‴?_`, `_≤‴?_`, `_≥‴?_`, and `_>‴?_` for deciding `≤‴` in `Data.Nat.Properties`.

* Moved `≡-dec` from `Data.Product.Properties.WithK` to `Data.Product.Properties`. The proof has been changed so that is uses that decidability implies UIP and no longer uses axiom K. Functions `injectiveʳ-≡` and `injectiveʳ-UIP` have also been added to `Data.Product.Properties`. Aliases have been added to `Data.Product.Properties.WithK` though there could be clashes in code which imports both modules.
