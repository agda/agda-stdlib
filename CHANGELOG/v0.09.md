Version 0.9
===========

The library has been tested using Agda version 2.4.2.1.

Important changes since 0.8.1:

* `Data.List.NonEmpty`

  Non-empty lists are no longer defined in terms of
  `Data.Product._×_`, instead, now they are defined as record with
  fields head and tail.

* Reflection API

  + Quoting levels was fixed. This fix could break some code (see Agda
    Issue [#1207](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/1269)).

  + The `Reflection.type` function returns a normalised
    `Reflection.Type` and `quoteTerm` returns an η-contracted
    `Reflection.Term` now. These changes could break some code (see
    Agda Issue [#1269](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/1269)).

  + The primitive function for showing names, `primShowQName`, is now
    exposed as `Reflection.showName`.

* Removed compatibility modules for `Props -> Properties` rename

  Use `Foo.Properties.Bar` instead of `Foo.Props.Bar`.
