* Added a folder "Logic" in src. This provides a formalization of several substructural logics based on chapter 2 of Greg Restall's "An Introduction to Substructural Logics". My hope is that this can provide a useful framework for anyone wanting to study a variety of logics in Agda. This was a master's research project done under Professor Stuart Kurtz, and I'm really happy with my work here - I would love to contribute to the standard library, and I am happy to make any appropriate modification to help with that.
