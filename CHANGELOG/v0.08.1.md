Version 0.8.1
=============

The library has been tested using Agda version 2.4.2.

Important changes since 0.8:

* Reflection API

  Agda 2.4.2 added support for literals, function definitions, pattern
  matching lambdas and absurd clause/patterns (see Agda release
  notes). The new supported entities were added to the
  `Reflection.agda` module.

* Modules renamed

  `Foo.Props.Bar` -> `Foo.Properties.Bar`

  The current compatibility modules `Foo.Props.Bar` will be removed in
  the next release.
