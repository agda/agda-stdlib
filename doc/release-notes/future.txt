------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support for the UHC backend has been added.

* The tri⟶irr function has been made more general.

* The field <-resp-≈ has been removed from the IsStrictTotalOrder
  record. The property can be derived (see the new lemma
  Relation.Binary.Consequences.trans∧tri⟶resp≈), and is available from
  the IsStrictTotalOrder record module.

* Various changes required by changes in Agda (see Agda CHANGELOG):

  ** Hiding some modules in import directives after fixing #836.

  ** Removed COMPILED_DATA for Bool.Base.agda.

  ** Removed the IRRAXIOM built-in from Irrelevance.agda

  ** Added BUILTIN bindings in Data/Integer.agda

  ** IO FFI calls work with the now Data.Text-backed String builtins.

  ** Added parentheses for fixing operators and sections parsing.

  ** Added BUILTIN binding in Data/Unit.agda.

  ** Various changes in Reflection.agda

  ** Use COMPILE and FOREIGN compiler pragmas instead of old deprecated ones.
