Version 2.0-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda 2.6.2.

Highlights
----------

* A golden testing library in `Test.Golden`. This allows you to run a set
  of tests and make sure their output matches an expected `golden' value.
  The test runner has many options: filtering tests by name, dumping the
  list of failures to a file, timing the runs, coloured output, etc.
  Cf. the comments in `Test.Golden` and the standard library's own tests
  in `tests/` for documentation on how to use the library.

Bug-fixes
---------

* In `System.Exit`, the `ExitFailure` constructor is now carrying an integer
  rather than a natural. The previous binding was incorrectly assuming that
  all exit codes where non-negative.

* In `/-monoˡ-≤` in `Data.Nat.DivMod` the parameter `o` was implicit but not inferrable. 
  It has been changed to be explicit.

* In `Function.Definitions` the definitions of `Surjection`, `Inverseˡ`, 
  `Inverseʳ` were not being re-exported correctly and therefore had an unsolved 
  meta-variable whenever this module was explicitly parameterised. This has
  been fixed.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

* In `Algebra.Morphism.Structures`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`,
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism`, and `IsRingHomomorphism` have been redeisgned to
  build up from `IsMonoidHomomorphism`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`, and
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism` respectively, adding a single property at each step.
  This means that they no longer need to have two separate proofs of
  `IsRelHomomorphism`. Similarly, `IsLatticeHomomorphism` is now built as
  `IsRelHomomorphism` along with proofs that `_∧_` and `_∨_` are homorphic.

  Also, `⁻¹-homo` in `IsRingHomomorphism` has been renamed to `-‿homo`.

* move definition of `_>>=_` under `Data.Vec.Base` to its submodule `CartesianBind`
  in order to keep another new definition of `_>>=_`, located in `DiagonalBind`
  which is also a submodule of `Data.Vec.Base`.

* In `Text.Pretty`, `Doc` is now a record rather than a type alias. This
  helps Agda reconstruct the `width` parameter when the module is opened
  without it being applied. In particular this allows users to write
  width-generic pretty printers and only pick a width when calling the
  renderer by using this import style:
  ```
  open import Text.Pretty using (Doc; render)
  --                      ^-- no width parameter for Doc & render
  open module Pretty {w} = Text.Pretty w hiding (Doc; render)
  --                 ^-- implicit width parameter for the combinators

  pretty : Doc w
  pretty = ? -- you can use the combinators here and there won't be any
             -- issues related to the fact that `w` cannot be reconstructed
             -- anymore

  main = do
    -- you can now use the same pretty with different widths:
    putStrLn $ render 40 pretty
    putStrLn $ render 80 pretty
  ```

* In `Text.Regex.Search` the `searchND` function finding infix matches has
  been tweaked to make sure the returned solution is a local maximum in terms
  of length. It used to be that we would make the match start as late as
  possible and finish as early as possible. It's now the reverse.

  So `[a-zA-Z]+.agdai?` run on "the path _build/Main.agdai corresponds to"
  will return "Main.agdai" when it used to be happy to just return "n.agda".

#### Proofs of non-zeroness as instance arguments

* Many numeric operations in the library require their arguments to be non-zero.
  The previous way of constructing and passing round these proofs resulted in clunky code.
  As described on the [mailing list](https://lists.chalmers.se/pipermail/agda/2021/012693.html)
  we have converted the operations to take the proofs of non-zeroness as irrelevant 
  [instance arguments](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/instance-arguments.html).
  See the mailing list for a fuller explanation of the motivation and implementation.

* For example the type signature of division is now:
  ```
  _/_ : (dividend divisor : ℕ) .{{_ : NonZero divisor}} → ℕ
  ```
  which means that as long as an instance of `NonZero n` is in scope then you can write
  `m / n` without having to explicitly provide a proof as instance search will fill it in
  for you. The full list of such operations changed is as follows:
    - In `Data.Nat.DivMod`: `_/_`, `_%_`, `_div_`, `_mod_`
	- In `Data.Nat.Pseudorandom.LCG`: `Generator`
	- In `Data.Integer.DivMod`: `_divℕ_`, `_div_`, `_modℕ_`, `_mod_`
	- In `Data.Rational`: `mkℚ+`, `normalize`, `_/_`, `1/_`
	- In `Data.Rational.Unnormalised`: `_/_`, `1/_`, `_÷_`

* Consequently the definition of `_≢0` has been removed from `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Base`
  and the following proofs about it have been removed from `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Properties`:
  ```
  p≄0⇒∣↥p∣≢0 : ∀ p → p ≠ 0ℚᵘ → ℤ.∣ (↥ p) ∣ ≢0
  ∣↥p∣≢0⇒p≄0 : ∀ p → ℤ.∣ (↥ p) ∣ ≢0 → p ≠ 0ℚᵘ
  ```

* At the moment, there are 4 different ways such instance arguments can be provided,
  listed in order of convenience and clarity:
    1. By default there is always an instance of `NonZero (suc n)` for any `n` which 
	   will be picked up automatically:
	   ```
	   0/n≡0 : 0 / suc n ≡ 0
	   ```
	2. You can take the proof an instance argument as a parameter, e.g. 
	   ```
	   0/n≡0 : {{_ : NonZero n}} → 0 / n ≡ 0
	   ```
	3. You can define an instance argument in scope higher-up (or in a `where` clause):
	   ```
	   instance 
	     n≢0 : NonZero n
	     n≢0 = ...

	   0/n≡0 : 0 / n ≡ 0
	   ```
	4. You can provide the instance argument explicitly, e.g. `0/n≡0 : ∀ n (n≢0 : NonZero n) → ((0 / n) {{n≢0}}) ≡ 0`
	   ```
	   0/n≡0 : ∀ n (n≢0 : NonZero n) → ((0 / n) {{n≢0}}) ≡ 0
	   ```

* Previously one of the hacks used in proofs was to explicitly put everything in the form `suc n`.
  This often made the proofs extremely difficult to use if you're term wasn't in that form. These
  proofs have now all been updated to use instance arguments instead, e.g.
  ```
  n/n≡1 : ∀ n → suc n / suc n ≡ 1 
  ```
  becomes
  ```
  n/n≡1 : ∀ n {{_ : NonZero n}} → n / n ≡ 1
  ```
  This does however mean that if you passed in the value `x` to these proofs before, then you
  will now have to pass in `suc x`. The full list of such proofs is below:
  - In `Data.Nat.Properties`:
	```agda
	*-cancelʳ-≡ : ∀ m n {o} → m * suc o ≡ n * suc o → m ≡ n

    ```

  - In `Data.Nat.Coprimality`:

	```

* A couple of other proofs in have also changed form:
  - In `Data.Nat.Properties`:
  ```

  *-cancelʳ-≤-pos : ∀ m n o → m * + suc o ≤ n * + suc o → m ≤ n
  ```

### Strict functions

* The module `Strict` has been deprecated in favour of `Function.Strict`
  and the definitions of strict application, `_$!_` and `_$!′_`, have been
  moved from `Function.Base` to `Function.Strict`.

* The contents of `Function.Strict` is now re-exported by `Function`.

### Other

* The constructors `+0` and `+[1+_]` from `Data.Integer.Base` are no longer
  exported by `Data.Rational.Base`. You will have to open `Data.Integer(.Base)`
  directly to use them.

* The relations `_≤_` `_≥_` `_<_` `_>_` in `Data.Fin.Base` have been
  generalised so they can now relate `Fin` terms with different indices.
  Should be mostly backwards compatible, but very occasionally when proving
  properties about the orderings themselves the second index must be provided
  explicitly.

Deprecated modules
------------------

### Deprecation of old function hierarchy

* The module `Function.Related` has been deprecated in favour of `Function.Related.Propositional`
  whose code uses the new function hierarchy. This also opens up the possibility of a more
  general `Function.Related.Setoid` at a later date. Several of the names have been changed
  in this process to bring them into line with the camelcase naming convention used
  in the rest of the library:
  ```agda
  reverse-implication ↦ reverseImplication 
  reverse-injection   ↦ reverseInjection
  left-inverse        ↦ leftInverse
  
  Symmetric-kind      ↦ SymmetricKind
