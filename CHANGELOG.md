Version 3.0
===========

The library has been tested using Agda 2.8.0.

Highlights
----------

* The notation for `Decidable` relations has been (partially) standardised: thus
  - `_≡?_` (at `infix 4`) for `DecidableEquality`
  - `_≈?_` (ditto.) for the general `IsDecEquivalence`

  At present, the old fieldname `_≟_` has been retained, in order to avoid
  a non-backwards compatible/breaking change of fieldname, which will plan
  to do in Version 3.0, with accompanying deprecation of that name, against
  its eventual removal in subsequent versions.

  The change leads to a number of (trivial) renamings/deprecations, others more
  substantive in `Data.{Nat|Fin}.Properties` for the concrete datatypes, which
  are summarised below, but are not each documented for all affected modules.
