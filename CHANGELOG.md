Version TODO
============

The library has been tested using Agda version TODO.

Important changes since 0.16:

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

#### Overhaul of safety of the library

* Currently the library is very difficult to type check with the `--safe`
  flag as there are unsafe functions scattered throughout the key modules.
  This means that it is almost impossible to verify the safety of any code
  depending on the standard library. The following reorganisation will fix
  this problem after the NEXT full release of Agda. (Agda 2.5.4.1 uses
  postulates in the `Agda.Builtin.X` that will be removed in the next release).

* The following new modules `Unsafe` have been created. The contents of
  these are  nearly all marked as unsafe as they use the `trustMe` functionality,
  either for performance reasons or for informative decidable equality tests.
  ```
  Data.Char.Unsafe
  Data.Float.Unsafe
  Data.Nat.Unsafe
  Data.Nat.DivMod.Unsafe
  Data.String.Unsafe
  Data.Word.Unsafe
  ```

* Another module affected is `Relation.Binary.HeterogeneousEquality.Quotients(.Examples)`
  which previously postulated function extensionality. The relevant submodules
  now take extensionality as a module parameter instead of postulating it. If you
  want to use these results then you should postulate it yourself.

* The full list of unsafe modules is:
  ```
  Data.Char.Unsafe
  Data.Float.Unsafe
  Data.Nat.Unsafe
  Data.Nat.DivMod.Unsafe
  Data.String.Unsafe
  Data.Word.Unsafe
  IO
  IO.Primitives
  Reflection
  Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality.TrustMe
  ```


#### New codata library

* A new `Codata` library using copatterns and sized types rather
  than musical notation has been added. The library is built around a generic
  notion of coinductive `Thunk` and provides the basic data types:
  ```agda
  Codata.Thunk

  Codata.Colist
  Codata.Conat
  Codata.Cofin
  Codata.Covec
  Codata.Delay
  Codata.M
  Codata.Stream
  ```
  Each coinductive type comes with a notion of bisimilarity in the corresponding
  `Codata.X.Bisimilarity` module and at least a couple of proofs demonstrating
  how they can be used in `Codata.X.Properties`. This library is somewhat
  experimental and may undergo minor changes in later versions.

* To avoid confusion, the old codata modules that previously lived in the `Data`
  directory have been moved to the folder `Codata.Musical`
  ```agda
  Data.Cofin  ↦ Codata.Musical.Cofin
  Data.Colist ↦ Codata.Musical.Colist
  Data.Conat  ↦ Codata.Musical.Conat
  Data.Covec  ↦ Codata.Musical.Covec
  Data.M      ↦ Codata.Musical.M
  Data.Stream ↦ Codata.Musical.Stream
  ```

* Each new-style coinduction type comes with two functions (`fromMusical` and
  `toMusical`) converting back and forth between old-style coinduction values
  and new-style ones.

* The type `Costring` and method `toCostring` have been moved from `Data.String`
  to a new module `Codata.Musical.Costring`.

#### Improved consistency between `Data.(List/Vec).(Any/All/Membership)`

* Added new module `Data.Vec.Any`.

* The type `_∈_` has been moved from `Data.Vec` to the new module
  `Data.Vec.Membership.Propositional` and has been reimplemented using
  `Any` from `Data.Vec.Any`. In particular this means that you must now
  pass a `refl` proof to the `here` constructor.

* The proofs associated with `_∈_` have been moved from `Data.Vec.Properties`
  to the new module  `Data.Vec.Membership.Propositional.Properties`
  and have been renamed as follows:
  ```agda
  ∈-++ₗ      ↦ ∈-++⁺ˡ
  ∈-++ᵣ      ↦ ∈-++⁺ʳ
  ∈-map      ↦ ∈-map⁺
  ∈-tabulate ↦ ∈-tabulate⁺
  ∈-allFin   ↦ ∈-allFin⁺
  ∈-allPairs ↦ ∈-allPairs⁺
  ∈⇒List-∈   ↦ ∈-toList⁺
  List-∈⇒∈   ↦ ∈-fromList⁺
  ```

* The proofs `All-universal` and `All-irrelevance` have been moved from
  `Data.(List/Vec).All.Properties` and renamed `universal` and `irrelevant` in
  `Data.(List/Vec).All`.

* The existing function `tabulate` in `Data.Vec.All` has been renamed
  `universal`. The name `tabulate` now refers to a function with following type:
  ```agda
  tabulate : (∀ i → P (Vec.lookup i xs)) → All P {k} xs
  ```

#### Deprecating `Data.Fin.Dec`:

* This module has been deprecated as its non-standard position
  was causing dependency cycles. The move also makes finding
  subset properties easier.

* The following proofs have been moved to `Data.Fin.Properties`:
  ```
  decFinSubset, any?, all?, ¬∀⟶∃¬-smallest, ¬∀⟶∃¬
  ```

* The following proofs have been moved to `Data.Fin.Subset.Properties`:
  ```
  _∈?_, _⊆?_, nonempty?, anySubset?, decLift
  ```
  The latter has been renamed to `Lift?`.

* The file `Data.Fin.Dec` still exists for backwards compatibility
  and exports all the old names, but may be removed in some
  future version.

#### Rearrangement of algebraic Solvers

* Standardised and moved the generic solver modules as follows:
  ```agda
  Algebra.RingSolver                        ↦ Algebra.Solver.Ring
  Algebra.Monoid-solver                     ↦ Algebra.Solver.Monoid
  Algebra.CommutativeMonoidSolver           ↦ Algebra.Solver.CommutativeMonoid
  Algebra.IdempotentCommutativeMonoidSolver ↦ Algebra.Solver.IdempotentCommutativeMonoid
  ```

* In order to avoid dependency cycles, special instances of solvers for the following
  data types have been moved from `Data.X.Properties` to new modules `Data.X.Solver`.
  The naming conventions for these solver modules have also been standardised.
  ```agda
  Data.Bool.Properties.RingSolver          ↦  Data.Bool.Solver.∨-∧-Solver
  Data.Bool.Properties.XorRingSolver       ↦  Data.Bool.Solver.xor-∧-Solver
  Data.Integer.Properties.RingSolver       ↦  Data.Integer.Solver.+-*-Solver
  Data.List.Properties.List-solver         ↦  Data.List.Solver.++-Solver
  Data.Nat.Properties.SemiringSolver       ↦  Data.Nat.Solver.+-*-Solver
  Function.Related.TypeIsomorphisms.Solver ↦ Function.Related.TypeIsomorphisms.Solver.×-⊎-Solver
  ```

* Renamed `Algebra.Solver.Ring.Natural-coefficients` to `Algebra.Solver.Ring.NaturalCoefficients`.

#### Overhaul of `Data.X.Categorical`

* Added new modules:
  ```
  Category.Comonad

  Data.List.NonEmpty.Categorical
  Data.Maybe.Categorical
  Data.Product.Categorical.Left
  Data.Product.Categorical.Right
  Data.Product.N-ary.Categorical
  Data.Sum.Categorical.Left
  Data.Sum.Categorical.Right
  Data.These.Categorical.Left
  Data.These.Categorical.Right

  Codata.Colist.Categorical
  Codata.Covec.Categorical
  Codata.Delay.Categorical
  Codata.Stream.Categorical
  ```

* In `Data.List.Categorical` renamed:
  ```agda
  sequence ↦ sequenceM
  ```

* Moved `monad` from `Data.List.NonEmpty` to `Data.List.NonEmpty.Categorical`.

* Moved `functor`, `monadT`, `monad`, `monadZero` and `monadPlus` from `Data.Maybe`
  to `Data.Maybe.Categorical`.

* Created new module `Function.Identity.Categorical` and merged the existing modules
  `Category.Functor.Identity` and `Category.Monad.Identity` into it.


#### Overhaul of `Data.Container`, `Data.W` and `Codata.(Musical.)M`

* Made `Data.Container` (and associated modules) more level-polymorphic

* Created `Data.Container.Core` for the core definition of `Container`,
  container morphisms `_⇒_`, `All` and `Any`. This breaks the dependency cycle
  with `Data.W` and `Codata.Musical.M`.

* Refactored `Data.W` and `Codata.Musical.M` to use `Container`.

#### Other

* The `Data.List.Relation.Sublist` directory has been moved to
  `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Extensional` to make room for the
  new `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Inductive` hierarchy.

* The types `IrrelevantPred` and `IrrelevantRel` in
  `Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality` have both been renamed to
  `Irrelevant` and have been moved to `Relation.Unary` and
  `Relation.Binary` respectively.

* Removed `Data.Char.Core` which was doing nothing of interest.

* In `Data.Maybe.Base` the `Set` argument to `From-just` has been made implicit
  to be consistent with the definition of `Data.Sum`'s `From-injₙ`.

* In `Data.Product` the function `,_` has been renamed to `-,_` to avoid
  conflict with the right section of `_,_`.

* Made `Data.Star.Decoration`, `Data.Star.Environment` and `Data.Star.Pointer`
  more level polymorphic. In particular `EdgePred` now takes an extra explicit
  level parameter.

* In `Level` the target level of `Lift` is now explicit.

* In `Function` the precedence level of `_$_` (and variants) has been changed to `-1`
  in order to improve its interaction with `_∋_` (e.g. `f $ Maybe A ∋ do (...)`).


Other major changes
-------------------

* Added new module `Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid`. This contains proofs
  of lots of properties of summation, including 'big summation'.

* Added new modules `Data.List.Relation.Permutation.Inductive(.Properties)`,
  which give an inductive definition of permutations over lists.

* Added a new module `Data.These` for the classic either-or-both Haskell datatype.

* Added new module `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Inductive` which gives
  an inductive definition of the sublist relation (i.e. order-preserving embeddings).
  We also provide a solver for this order in `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Inductive.Solver`.

* Added new modules `Relation.Unary.Closure.(Preorder/StrictPartialOrder)` providing
  closures of a predicate with respect to either a preorder or a strict partial order.

Deprecated features
-------------------

The following deprecations have occurred as part of a drive to improve consistency across
the library. The deprecated names still exist and therefore all existing code should still
work, however they have been deprecated and use of any new names is encouraged. Although not
anticipated any time soon, they may eventually be removed in some future release of the library.

* All deprecated names now give warnings at point-of-use when type-checked.

* In `Data.Nat.Divisibility`:
  ```
  nonZeroDivisor-lemma
  ```

* In `Function.Related`
  ```agda
  preorder              ↦ R-preorder
  setoid                ↦ SR-setoid
  EquationReasoning.sym ↦ SR-sym
  ```

* In `Function.Related.TypeIsomorphisms`:
