Version 3.0
===========

The library has been tested using Agda 2.8.0.

Highlights
----------

* Modules that previously used `--cubical-compatible` once again use `--without-K`.

* The notation for `Decidable` relations has been (partially) standardised: thus
  - `_≡?_` (at `infix 4`) for `DecidableEquality`
  - `_≈?_` (ditto.) for the general `IsDecEquivalence`

  At present, the old fieldname `_≟_` has been retained, in order to avoid
  a non-backwards compatible/breaking change of fieldname, which will plan
  to do in Version 3.0, with accompanying deprecation of that name, against
  its eventual removal in subsequent versions.

  The change leads to a number of (trivial) renamings/deprecations, others more
  substantive in `Data.{Nat|Fin}.Properties` for the concrete datatypes, which
  are summarised below, but are not each documented for all affected modules.

Bug-fixes
---------

* Fix a bug in `Data.List.Base`'s `linesBy` (the last empty line would be dropped).

* [issue #3003](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/3003)
  Uncorrected, the existing axiomatisation of `Algebra.Structures.IsKleeneAlgebra`
  meant that it was possible to prove that `0# ⋆ ≈ 1#`. As a consequence, the
  axioms have been corrected so that fields `starExpansive` and `starDestructive`
  now refer to the partial order relation `_≤_`, which is definable from the
  `+-isCommutativeBand` substructure. As a further knock-on consequence, module
  `Algebra.Properties.KleeneAlgebra` has been completely superseded in order to
  accommodate the new axiomatisation.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

* The notation for `Decidable` relations has been (partially) standardised: thus
  - `_≡?_` (at `infix 4`) for `DecidableEquality`
  - `_≈?_` (ditto.) for the fieldname of the general `IsDecEquivalence`

  Despite being non-backwards compatible, because a fieldname has changed, the
  old notation `_≟_` (which was used for both of the above) has been retained,
  but deprecated. This leads to a large amount of (trivial) deprecations, in
  addition to the substantive one under `Relation.Binary.Structures`, and in
  `Data.{Nat|Fin}.Properties` for the concrete datatypes. These deprecations
  are summarised below, but are not each documented for each affected module.

* [issue #2547](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/2547)
  The names of the *implicit* binders in the following definitions have been
  rectified to be consistent with the rest of `Relation.Binary.Definitions`:
  `Transitive`, `Antisym`, and `Antisymmetric`.

* [Issue #2548](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/2458)
  Consistent with other names (such as `∙-cong`, `ε-homo` etc.) in
  `Algebra.*`, the field name of the basic homomorphism property `homo` in
  `Algebra.Morphism.Structures.IsMagmaHomomorphism` has been renamed to `∙-homo`.


* [Issue #3022](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/3022)
  The previous development of rose trees has been refactored to make
  the definitions `safe` wrt termination checking etc. by avoiding
  the use of `sized-types`, at the cost of a little extra plumbing.

Minor improvements
------------------

* [Issue #2502](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/2502) The module
  `Algebra.Consequences.Base` now takes the underlying equality relation as
  an additional top-level parameter, with slightly improved ergonomics wrt
  subsequent imports by clients, as well as streamlined internals. Moreover,
  it now has the implicit parameters of its internal modules lifted out as
  global `variable`s.

New modules
-----------

* `Algebra.Properties.KleeneAlgebra` has been completely rewritten.

* `Codata.Guarded.Stream.Relation.Unary.Linked` for a proof that each pair
  of consecutive elements of a stream are related.

* `Data.Bool.ListAction.Properties` for properties of conjunction and
  disjunction of lists.

* A new type of lists that grow on the right.
  This is typically useful to model contexts of typing rules
  or type accumulators that need to be reversed in the base case.
  ```
  Data.SnocList.Base
  ```

* A namespace for the (unsafe) use of `sized-types` to define rose trees
  and their associated operations, previously defined under `Data.Tree`,
  with the intention of migrating all such uses of sized datatypes here.
  ```
  Data.Sized
  Data.Sized.Tree
  ```
  Correspondingly, the previous development of rose trees has been refactored
  to make the definitions `safe` wrt termination checking etc.
