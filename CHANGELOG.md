Version 2.0-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda 2.6.2.

Highlights
----------

* A golden testing library in `Test.Golden`. This allows you to run a set
  of tests and make sure their output matches an expected `golden' value.
  The test runner has many options: filtering tests by name, dumping the
  list of failures to a file, timing the runs, coloured output, etc.
  Cf. the comments in `Test.Golden` and the standard library's own tests
  in `tests/` for documentation on how to use the library.

Bug-fixes
---------

* In `System.Exit`, the `ExitFailure` constructor is now carrying an integer
  rather than a natural. The previous binding was incorrectly assuming that
  all exit codes where non-negative.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

* In `Algebra.Morphism.Structures`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`,
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism`, and `IsRingHomomorphism` have been redeisgned to
  build up from `IsMonoidHomomorphism`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`, and
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism` respectively, adding a single property at each step.
  This means that they no longer need to have two separate proofs of
  `IsRelHomomorphism`. Similarly, `IsLatticeHomomorphism` is now built as
  `IsRelHomomorphism` along with proofs that `_∧_` and `_∨_` are homorphic.

  Also, `⁻¹-homo` in `IsRingHomomorphism` has been renamed to `-‿homo`.

* move definition of `_>>=_` under `Data.Vec.Base` to its submodule `CartesianBind`
  in order to keep another new definition of `_>>=_`, located in `DiagonalBind`
  which is also a submodule of `Data.Vec.Base`.

* In `Text.Pretty`, `Doc` is now a record rather than a type alias. This
  helps Agda reconstruct the `width` parameter when the module is opened
  without it being applied. In particular this allows users to write
  width-generic pretty printers and only pick a width when calling the
  renderer by using this import style:
  ```
  open import Text.Pretty using (Doc; render)
  --                      ^-- no width parameter for Doc & render
  open module Pretty {w} = Text.Pretty w hiding (Doc; render)
  --                 ^-- implicit width parameter for the combinators

  pretty : Doc w
  pretty = ? -- you can use the combinators here and there won't be any
             -- issues related to the fact that `w` cannot be reconstructed
             -- anymore

  main = do
    -- you can now use the same pretty with different widths:
    putStrLn $ render 40 pretty
    putStrLn $ render 80 pretty
  ```

* In `Text.Regex.Search` the `searchND` function finding infix matches has
  been tweaked to make sure the returned solution is a local maximum in terms
  of length. It used to be that we would make the match start as late as
  possible and finish as early as possible. It's now the reverse.

  So `[a-zA-Z]+.agdai?` run on "the path _build/Main.agdai corresponds to"
  will return "Main.agdai" when it used to be happy to just return "n.agda".

### Strict functions

* The module `Strict` has been deprecated in favour of `Function.Strict`
  and the definitions of strict application, `_$!_` and `_$!′_`, have been
  moved from `Function.Base` to `Function.Strict`.

* The contents of `Function.Strict` is now re-exported by `Function`.

### Other

* The constructors `+0` and `+[1+_]` from `Data.Integer.Base` are no longer
  exported by `Data.Rational.Base`. You will have to open `Data.Integer(.Base)`
  directly to use them.

* The relations `_≤_` `_≥_` `_<_` `_>_` in `Data.Fin.Base` have been
  generalised so they can now relate `Fin` terms with different indices.
  Should be mostly backwards compatible, but very occasionally when proving
  properties about the orderings themselves the second index must be provided
  explicitly.
