Version 1.2-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda version 2.6.0.1.

Changes since 1.1:

Highlights
----------

* New function record hierarchy.

Bug-fixes
---------

* In `Relation.Binary`:
  - `IsStrictTotalOrder` now exports `isDecStrictPartialOrder`
  - `IsDecStrictPartialOrder` now re-exports the contents of `IsStrictPartialOrder`.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

### Standardisation of record hierarchies

* Currently the main record hierarchies `Algebra`, `Relation.Binary`
  and `Function` are inconsistently structured.

* For example if you import `Relation.Binary` you get all parts of the hierarchy,
  e.g. `Reflexive`, `IsPreorder` and `Preorder`. Whereas you have
  to import `Associative` from `Algebra.FunctionProperties`, `IsSemigroup`
  from `Algebra.Structures` and `Semigroup` from `Algebra`.

* Consequently all hierarchies have been re-organised to follow the
  same pattern:
  ```agda
  X.Core         -- Contains: Rel, Op₂, Fun etc.
  X.Definitions  -- Contains: Reflexive, Associative, Injective etc.
  X.Structures   -- Contains: IsEquivalence, IsSemigroup, IsInjection etc.
  X.Bundles      -- Contains: Setoid, Semigroup, Injection etc.
  X              -- Publicly re-exports all of the above
  ```

* For `Relation.Binary` this means:
  * New module `Relation.Binary.Bundles`
  * New module `Relation.Binary.Definitions`
  * Fully backwards compatible.

* For `Algebra` this means:
  * `Algebra.FunctionProperties` has been deprecated in favour of `Algebra.Definitions`.
  * `Algebra` now exports the contents of `Algebra.Definitions` and `Algebra.Structures`,
  not just that of `Algebra.Bundles`.
  * **Compatibility:** In modules which previously imported both `Algebra` and
  `Algebra.FunctionProperties/Structures` where the latter was parameterised by an
  equality relation `_≈_`, it will be necessary to import `Algebra.Bundles` instead of `Algebra`.

* A new hiearchy has been created for `Function` (see the next section).

* Other smaller record hierarchies have undergone the same treatment:
  ```agda
  Relation.Binary.Indexed.Homogeneous
  Relation.Binary.Indexed.Heterogeneous
  ```

### New function hierarchy

* The old way the function hierarchy is represented in the library
had several problems:
  1. The raw functions were wrapped in the equality-preserving
     type `_⟶_` from `Function.Equality`. As the rest of the library
     very rarely used such wrapped functions, it was almost impossible
     to write code that interfaced neatly between the `Function` hierarchy
     and, for example, the `Algebra` hierarchy.
  2. The symbol `_⟶_` that was used for equality preserving functions
     was almost indistinguishable from ordinary functions `_→_` in many fonts,
     leading to confusion when reading code.
  3. The hierarchy didn't follow the same pattern as the other record
     hierarchies in the standard library, e.g. `Injective`, `IsInjection`
         and `Injection`. Coupled with point 1., anecdotally this meant that
         people found it difficult to understand and use.
  4. There was no way of specifying a function has a specific property
     (e.g. is injective) without specifying all the properties required
     of the equality relation as well. This is in contrast to the
     `Relation.Binary` and `Algebra` hierarchies where it is perfectly
     possible to specify that for example an operation is commutative
     without providing all the proofs associated with the equality relation.

* To address these problems a new function hierarchy similar to the ones in
`Relation.Binary` and `Algebra` has been created:
  - The contents of `Function` has been moved to `Function.Core`
  - New module `Function.Definitions` containing definitions like `Injective`,
    `Surjective` which is parameterised by the equality relations
    over the domain and codomain.
  - New module `Function.Structures` containing definitions like `IsInjection`,
    `IsSurjection`, once again parameterised the equality relations.
  - New module `Function.Bundles` containing definitions like `Injection`, `Surjection`
     which provide essentially the same top-level interface as currently exists,
     i.e. parameterised by setoids but hiding the function.
  - The module `Function` now re-exports the whole of this hierarchy.

* **Compatibility:** As most of the above modules are new, these changes are nearly
entirely backwards compatible. The only problem is when code imports both `Function`
and e.g. `Function.Injection` in which case the old and new definitions of `Injection`
will clash. In the short term this can be fixed immediately by importing `Function.Core`
instead of `Function`. However we would encourage migrating to the new hierarchy in
the medium to long term.

* The following modules containing the old hierarchy will be deprecated at some
point in the future when contents in other parts of the library has been
updated to use the new hierarchy:
  ```agda
  Function.Equivalence
  Function.Equality
  Function.Bijection
  Function.Injection
  Function.Surjection
  Function.LeftInverse
  ```

* The list of new modules is as follows:
  ```agda
  Function.Construct.Identity
  Function.Construct.Composition
  ```

* Minor change: the propositional bundle for left inverses in `Function.Bundles`
  has been renamed from `_↞_` to `_↩_` in order to make room for the new bundle
  for right inverse `_↪_`.

### Re-implementation of `Data.Bin`

* The current implementation of naturals represented natively in Agda in `Data.Bin`
  has proven hard to work with. Therefore a new, simpler implementation which avoids
  using `List` has been added as `Data.Nat.Binary`. This representation was inspired
  by the letter by Martin Escardo to the Agda mailing list. The original code resides at
  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/agda-new/BinaryNaturals.html

* The existing modules `Data.Bin` and `Data.Bin.Properties` still exist but have been
  deprecated and may be removed in some future release of the library.

### Addition of the `Reflects` idiom

* A version of the `Reflects` idiom, as seen in SSReflect, has been introduced
in `Relation.Nullary`. Some properties of it have been added in
`Relation.Nullary.Reflects`. The definition is as follows
  ```agda
  data Reflects {p} (P : Set p) : Bool → Set p where
    ofʸ : ( p :   P) → Reflects P true
    ofⁿ : (¬p : ¬ P) → Reflects P false
  ```

* `Dec` has been redefined in terms of `Reflects`.
  ```agda
  record Dec {p} (P : Set p) : Set p where
    constructor _because_
    field
      does : Bool
      proof : Reflects P does

  open Dec public

  pattern yes p =  true because ofʸ  p
  pattern no ¬p = false because ofⁿ ¬p
  ```
This change should be backwards compatible thanks to the pattern synonyms.
However, decision procedures can now be built in such a way that a boolean
result is given independently of the proof that it is the correct decision.
See, for example, this proof of decidability of _≤_ on natural numbers.
  ```agda
  _≤?_ : (m n : ℕ) → Dec (m ≤ n)
  zero  ≤?    n = yes z≤n
  suc m ≤? zero = no λ ()
  does  (suc m ≤? suc n) = does (m ≤? n)
  proof (suc m ≤? suc n) with m ≤? n
  ... | yes p = ofʸ (s≤s p)
  ... | no ¬p = ofⁿ (¬p ∘ ≤-pred)
  ```
Notice that if we project the `does` field, we get a function which behaves
identically to what we would expect of a boolean test. This can have
advantages for both performance and reasoning.

### Other breaking changes

#### Harmonizing `List.All` and `Vec` in their role as finite maps.

`Data.List.Relation.Unary.All.updateAt` is analogous to
`Data.Vec.updateAt` and thus, the API for `All` has been changed to
match the one for `Vec`:

* The "points-to" relation `_[_]=_` for vectors has been ported to `All`.

* The property
  `Data.List.Relation.Unary.All.Properties.updateAt-updates` is now
  formulated in terms of the new "points-to" relation `_[_]=_` rather than
  the `lookup` function.  The old property is (in a minor variant)
  available under the name `lookup∘updateAt`.

* `updateAt-cong` has been renamed to `updateAt-cong-relative`, and a new
  `updateAt-cong` has been ported from `Vec`.

* Further properties of `Vec` have been ported to `All`:
  ```
  []=lookup
  []=⇒lookup
  lookup⇒[]=
  updateAt-minimal
  updateAt-id-relative
  updateAt-compose-relative
  updateAt-commutes
  ```


#### Other

* The proofs `isPreorder` and `preorder` have been moved from the `Setoid`
  record to the module `Relation.Binary.Properties.Setoid`.

Relocated modules
-----------------
The following modules have been moved as part of a drive to improve
usability and consistency across the library. The old modules still exist and
therefore all existing code should still work, however they have been deprecated
and, although not anticipated any time soon, they may eventually
be removed in some future release of the library. After the next release of Agda
automated warnings will be attached to these modules to discourage their use.


Deprecated names
----------------
The following deprecations have occurred as part of a drive to improve
consistency across the library. The deprecated names still exist and
therefore all existing code should still work, however use of the new names
is encouraged. Although not anticipated any time soon, they may eventually
be removed in some future release of the library. Automated warnings are
attached to all deprecated names to discourage their use.

* In `Data.Unit`:
  `_≤_` was really not very useful as defined, as it was isomorphic to
  `_≡_` which is now its definition.  Multiple names have been
  deprecated because of this. `≤-reflexive` is just `id`, and
  `≤-trans` is `trans`.

  ```agda
  ≤-total ↦ ≡-total
  _≤?_ ↦ _≟_
  ≤-isPreorder ↦ ≡-isPreorder
  ≤-isPartialOrder ↦ ≡-isPartialOrder
  ≤-isTotalOrder ↦ ≡-isTotalOrder
  ≤-isDecTotalOrder ↦ ≡-isDecTotalOrder
  ≤-poset ↦ ≡-poset
  ≤-decTotalOrder ↦ ≡-decTotalOrder
  ```

* In `Data.Integer.Properties`:
  ```agda
  [1+m]*n≡n+m*n ↦ suc-*
  ```

* In `Data.Nat.Properties`:
  ```agda
  +-*-suc ↦ *-suc

  ```

* In `Relation.Binary.Properties.Poset`:
  ```agda
  invIsPartialOrder  ↦ ≥-isPartialOrder
  invPoset           ↦ ≥-poset
  strictPartialOrder ↦ <-strictPartialOrder
  ```

* In `Relation.Binary.Properties.DecTotalOrder`:
  ```agda
  strictTotalOrder ↦ <-strictTotalOrder
  ```

* In `Relation.Nullary.Decidable.Core`:
  ```agda
  ⌊_⌋ ↦ isYes
  ```

  these-injective : these x a ≡ these y b → x ≡ y × a ≡ b
  ```

* Added new definitions to `Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Pointwise.Inductive`:
  ```agda
  uncons : Pointwise _∼_ (x ∷ xs) (y ∷ ys) → x ∼ y × Pointwise _∼_ xs ys
  ```

* Added new definitions to `Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.All`:
  ```agda
  uncons : All P (x ∷ xs) → P x × All P xs
  ```

* Added new definitions to `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Reflexive.Properties`:
  ```agda
  fromSum :  a ≡ b ⊎ a ~ b  → Refl _~_ a b
  toSum   :  Refl _~_ a b   → a ≡ b ⊎ a ~ b
  ⊎⇔Refl  : (a ≡ b ⊎ a ~ b) ⇔ Refl _~_ a b
  ```
