Version 3.0
===========

The library has been tested using Agda 2.8.0.

Highlights
----------

* The notation for `Decidable` relations has been (partially) standardised: thus
  - `_≡?_` (at `infix 4`) for `DecidableEquality`
  - `_≈?_` (ditto.) for the general `IsDecEquivalence`

  At present, the old fieldname `_≟_` has been retained, in order to avoid
  a non-backwards compatible/breaking change of fieldname, which will plan
  to do in Version 3.0, with accompanying deprecation of that name, against
  its eventual removal in subsequent versions.

  The change leads to a number of (trivial) renamings/deprecations, others more
  substantive in `Data.{Nat|Fin}.Properties` for the concrete datatypes, which
  are summarised below, but are not each documented for all affected modules.

Bug-fixes
---------

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

* [issue #2471](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/2471) In
  `Relation.Binary.Definitions`, the left/right order of the components of
  `_Respects₂_` have been swapped. Previously the position of the `_Respectsˡ_`
  (respects left) component was placed on the *right* hand side of the pair and
  `_Respectsʳ_` (respects right) was placed on the *left* hand side of the pair.
  By switching them the names are now consistent with their location.

* In `Data.Fin.Properties`:
  ```agda
  _≟_      ↦  _≡?_
