Version TODO
============

The library has been tested using Agda version 2.5.4.1.

Important changes since 0.17:

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

#### Overhaul of `Data.Maybe`

Splitting up `Data.Maybe` into the standard hierarchy.

* Moved `Data.Maybe.Base`'s `Is-just`, `Is-nothing`, `to-witness`,
  and `to-witness-T` to `Data.Maybe` (they rely on `All` and `Any`
  which are now outside of `Data.Maybe.Base`).

* Moved `Data.Maybe.Base`'s `All` and `Data.Maybe`'s `allDec` to
  `Data.Maybe.All` and renamed some proofs:
  ```agda
  allDec ↦ dec
  ```

* Moved `Data.Maybe.Base`'s `Any` and `Data.Maybe`'s `anyDec` to
  `Data.Maybe.Any` and renamed some proofs:
  ```agda
  anyDec ↦ dec
  ```

* Created `Data.Maybe.Properties`, moved `Data.Maybe.Base`'s `just-injective`
  there and populated it with basic results.

* Moved `Data.Maybe`'s `Eq` to `Data.Maybe.Relation.Pointwise` and
  renamed some proofs:
  ```agda
  Eq                  ↦ Pointwise
  Eq-refl             ↦ refl
  Eq-sym              ↦ sym
  Eq-trans            ↦ trans
  Eq-dec              ↦ dec
  Eq-isEquivalence    ↦ isEquivalence
  Eq-isDecEquivalence ↦ isDecEquivalence
  ```

Other major changes
-------------------

* Added new module `Data.Vec.Any.Properties`

Deprecated features
-------------------
