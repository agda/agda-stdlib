Version 1.5-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda 2.6.1 and 2.6.1.1.

Highlights
----------

Bug-fixes
---------

* The example module `Maybe` in `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Reflexive` was
  accidentally exposed publicly. It has been made private.

* Fixed the type of the proof `map-id` in `List.Relation.Unary.All.Properties`,
  which was incorrectly abstracted over unused module parameters.

* Fixed bug where `IsRelIsomorphism` in `Relation.Binary.Morphism.Structures` did not
  publicly re-export the contents of `IsRelMonomorphism`.

* The binary relation `_≉_` exposed by records in `Relation.Binary.Bundles` now has
  the correct infix precedence.

* Fixed the fixity of the reasoning combinators in
  `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Subset.(Propositional/Setoid).Properties`so that they
  compose properly.

* Added version to library name

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

* The internal build utilities package `lib.cabal` has been renamed
  `agda-stdlib-utils.cabal` to avoid potential conflict or confusion.
  Please note that the package is not intended for external use.

* The module `Algebra.Construct.Zero` and `Algebra.Module.Construct.Zero`
  are now level-polymorphic, each taking two implicit level parameters.

* Previously `_⊖_` in `Data.Integer.Base` was defined inductively as:
  ```agda
  _⊖_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℤ
  m       ⊖ ℕ.zero  = + m
  ℕ.zero  ⊖ ℕ.suc n = -[1+ n ]
  ℕ.suc m ⊖ ℕ.suc n = m ⊖ n
  ```
  which meant that it had to recursively evaluate its unary arguments.
  The definition has been changed as follows to use operations on `ℕ` that are backed
  by builtin operations, greatly improving its performance:
  ```agda
  _⊖_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℤ
  m ⊖ n with m ℕ.<ᵇ n
  ... | true  = - + (n ℕ.∸ m)
  ... | false = + (m ℕ.∸ n)
  ```

* The proofs `↭⇒∼bag` and `∼bag⇒↭` have been moved from
  `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Permutation.Setoid.Properties`
  to `Data.List.Relation.Binary.BagAndSetEquality` as their current location
  were causing cyclic import dependencies.

* Clean up of `IO` to make it more friendly:
  + Renamed `_>>=_` and `_>>_` to `bind` and `seq` respectively to free up the names
    for `do`-notation friendly combinators.
  + Introduced `Colist` and `List` modules for the various `sequence` and `mapM` functions.
    This breaks code that relied on the `Colist`-specific function being exported as part of `IO`.


Deprecated modules
------------------

* The module `TransitiveClosure` in `Induction.WellFounded` has been deprecated.
  You should instead use the standard definition of transitive closure and the
  accompanying proof of well-foundness defined in `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Transitive`.

* The module `Relation.Binary.OrderMorphism` has been deprecated, as the new
  `(Homo/Mono/Iso)morphism` infrastructure in `Algebra.Morphism.Structures` is now
  complete. The new definitions are parameterised by raw bundles instead of bundles
  meaning they are much more flexible to work with.

* The module `Algebra.Operations.CommutativeMonoid` has been deprecated. The definition
  of multiplication and the associated properties have been moved to
  `Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid.Multiplication`. The definition of summation
  which was defined over the deprecated `Data.Table` has been redefined in terms of
  `Data.Vec.Functional` and been moved to `Algbra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid.Summation`.
  The properties of summation in `Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid` have likewise
  been deprecated and moved to `Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid.Summation`.

Deprecated names
----------------

* The immediate contents of `Algebra.Morphism` have been deprecated, as the new
  `(Homo/Mono/Iso)morphism` infrastructure in `Algebra.Morphism.Structures` is now
  complete. The new definitions are parameterised by raw bundles instead of bundles
  meaning they are much more flexible to work with. The replacements are as following:
  ```agda
  IsSemigroupMorphism                   ↦ IsSemigroupHomomorphism
  IsMonoidMorphism                      ↦ IsMonoidHomomorphism
  IsCommutativeMonoidMorphism           ↦ IsMonoidHomomorphism
  IsIdempotentCommutativeMonoidMorphism ↦ IsMonoidHomomorphism
  IsGroupMorphism                       ↦ IsGroupHomomorphism
  IsAbelianGroupMorphism                ↦ IsGroupHomomorphism
  ```

* In `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Reflexive`:
  ```agda
  Refl ↦ ReflClosure
  ```

* In `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Transitive`:
  ```agda
  Plus′ ↦ TransClosure
  ```

* In `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Subset.Propositional.Properties`:
  ```agda
  mono            ↦ Any-resp-⊆
  map-mono        ↦ map⁺
  concat-mono     ↦ concat⁺
  >>=-mono        ↦ >>=⁺
  _⊛-mono_        ↦ ⊛⁺
  _⊗-mono_        ↦ ⊗⁺
  any-mono        ↦ any⁺
  map-with-∈-mono ↦ map-with-∈⁺
  filter⁺         ↦ filter-⊆
  ```

* In `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Subset.Setoid.Properties`:
    ```agda
  filter⁺         ↦ filter-⊆
  ```

New modules
-----------

* Added various generic morphism constructions for binary relations:
  ```agda
  Relation.Binary.Morphism.Construct.Composition
  Relation.Binary.Morphism.Construct.Constant
  Relation.Binary.Morphism.Construct.Identity
  ```

* Added `Reflection.Traversal` for generic de Bruijn-aware traversals of reflected terms.
* Added `Reflection.DeBruijn` with weakening, strengthening and free variable operations
  on reflected terms.

* Added `Relation.Binary.TypeClasses` for type classes to be used with instance search.

* Added various modules containing `instance` declarations:
  `Data.Bool.Instances`, `Data.Char.Instances`, `Data.Fin.Instances`,
  `Data.Float.Instances`, `Data.Integer.Instances`,
  `Data.List.Instances`, `Data.Nat.Instances`,
  `Data.Nat.Binary.Instances`, `Data.Product.Instances`,
  `Data.Rational.Instances`, `Data.Sign.Instances`,
  `Data.String.Instances`, `Data.Sum.Instances`,
  `Data.These.Instances`, `Data.Unit.Instances`,
  `Data.Unit.Polymorphic.Instances`, `Data.Vec.Instances`,
  `Data.Word.Instances`, and `Reflection.Instances`.

* Generic divisibility over algebraic structures
  ```
  Algebra.Divisibility
  Algebra.Properties.Magma.Divisibility
  Algebra.Properties.Semigroup.Divisibility
  Algebra.Properties.Monoid.Divisibility
  Algebra.Properties.CommutativeSemigroup.Divisibility
  ```

* Generic summations over algebraic structures
  ```
  Algebra.Properties.Monoid.Summation
  Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid.Summation
  ```

* Generic multiplication over algebraic structures
  ```
  Algebra.Properties.Monoid.Multiplication
  ```

* Setoid equality over vectors:
  ```
  Data.Vec.Functional.Relation.Binary.Equality.Setoid
  ```

* Heterogeneous relation characterising a list as an infix segment of another:
  ```
  Data.List.Relation.Binary.Infix.Heterogeneous
  Data.List.Relation.Binary.Infix.Heterogeneous.Properties
  ```
  and added `Properties` file for the homogeneous variants of (pre/in/suf)fix:
  ```
  Data.List.Relation.Binary.Prefix.Homogeneous.Properties
  Data.List.Relation.Binary.Infix.Homogeneous.Properties
  Data.List.Relation.Binary.Suffix.Homogeneous.Properties
  ```

* Added bindings for Haskell's `System.Environment`:
  ```
  System.Environment
  System.Environment.Primitive
  ```

Other major changes
-------------------

* The new module `Relation.Binary.TypeClasses` re-exports `_≟_` from
  `IsDecEquivalence` and `_≤?_` from `IsDecTotalOrder` where the
  principal argument has been made into an instance argument. This
  enables automatic resolution if the corresponding module
  `Data.*.Instances` (or `Reflection.Instances`) is imported as well.
  For example, if `Relation.Binary.TypeClasses`, `Data.Nat.Instances`,
  and `Data.Bool.Instances` have been imported, then `true ≟ true` has
  type `Dec (true ≡ true)`, while `0 ≟ 1` has type `Dec (0 ≡ 1)`. More
  examples can be found in `README.Relation.Binary.TypeClasses`.
