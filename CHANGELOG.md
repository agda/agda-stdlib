Version 2.0-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda 2.6.3.

Highlights
----------

* A golden testing library in `Test.Golden`. This allows you to run a set
  of tests and make sure their output matches an expected `golden` value.
  The test runner has many options: filtering tests by name, dumping the
  list of failures to a file, timing the runs, coloured output, etc.
  Cf. the comments in `Test.Golden` and the standard library's own tests
  in `tests/` for documentation on how to use the library.

* A new tactic `cong!` available from `Tactic.Cong` which automatically
  infers the argument to `cong` for you via anti-unification.

* Improved the `solve` tactic in `Tactic.RingSolver` to work in a much
  wider range of situations.

* Added `⌊log₂_⌋` and `⌈log₂_⌉` on Natural Numbers.

* A massive refactoring of the unindexed Functor/Applicative/Monad hierarchy
  and the MonadReader / MonadState type classes. These are now usable with
  instance arguments as demonstrated in the tests/monad examples.


Bug-fixes
---------

* The combinators `_⟶-∘_`, `_↣-∘_`, `_↠-∘_`, `_⤖-∘_`, `_⇔-∘_`, `_↩-∘_`, `_↪-∘_`, `_↔-∘_`
  in `Function.Construct.Composition` had their arguments in the wrong order. They have
  been flipped so they can actually be used as a composition operator.

* The following operators were missing a fixity declaration, which has now
  been fixed -

* In `System.Exit`, the `ExitFailure` constructor is now carrying an integer
  rather than a natural. The previous binding was incorrectly assuming that
  all exit codes where non-negative.

* In `/-monoˡ-≤` in `Data.Nat.DivMod` the parameter `o` was implicit but not inferrable.
  It has been changed to be explicit.

* In `+-distrib-/-∣ʳ` in `Data.Nat.DivMod` the parameter `m` was implicit but not inferrable,
  while `n` is explicit but inferrable.  They have been changed.

* In `Function.Definitions` the definitions of `Surjection`, `Inverseˡ`,
  `Inverseʳ` were not being re-exported correctly and therefore had an unsolved
  meta-variable whenever this module was explicitly parameterised. This has
  been fixed.

* Add module `Algebra.Module` that re-exports the contents of
  `Algebra.Module.(Definitions/Structures/Bundles)`

* Various module-like bundles in `Algebra.Module.Bundles` were missing a fixity
  declaration for `_*ᵣ_`. This has been fixed.

* In `Algebra.Definitions.RawSemiring` the record `prime` add `p∤1 : p ∤ 1#` to the field.

* In `Data.List.Relation.Ternary.Appending.Setoid` we re-export specialised versions of
  the constructors using the setoid's carrier set. Prior to that, the constructor were
  re-exported in their full generality which would lead to unsolved meta variables at
  their use sites.

* In `Data.Container.FreeMonad`, we give a direct definition of `_⋆_` as an inductive
  type rather than encoding it as an instance of `μ`. This ensures Agda notices that
  `C ⋆ X` is strictly positive in `X` which in turn allows us to use the free monad
  when defining auxiliary (co)inductive types (cf. the `Tap` example in
  `README.Data.Container.FreeMonad`).

* In `Data.Maybe.Base` the fixity declaration of `_<∣>_` was missing. This has been fixed.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

#### Removed deprecated names

* All modules and names that were deprecated in v1.2 and before have been removed.

#### Moved `Codata` modules to `Codata.Sized`

* Due to the change in Agda 2.6.2 where sized types are no longer compatible
  with the `--safe` flag, it has become clear that a third variant of codata
  will be needed using coinductive records. Therefore all existing modules in
  `Codata` which used sized types have been moved inside a new folder named
  `Sized`, e.g. `Codata.Stream` has become `Codata.Sized.Stream`.

#### Moved `Category` modules to `Effect`

* As observed by Wen Kokke in Issue #1636, it no longer really makes sense
  to group the modules which correspond to the variety of concepts of
  (effectful) type constructor arising in functional programming (esp. in haskell)
  such as `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Functor`, etc, under `Category.*`, as this
  obstructs the importing of the `agda-categories` development into the Standard Library,
  and moreover needlessly restricts the applicability of categorical concepts to this
  (highly specific) mode of use. Correspondingly, client modules grouped under `*.Categorical.*` which exploit such structure for effectful programming have been renamed `*.Effectful`, with the originals being deprecated.

### Improvements to pretty printing and regexes

* In `Text.Pretty`, `Doc` is now a record rather than a type alias. This
  helps Agda reconstruct the `width` parameter when the module is opened
  without it being applied. In particular this allows users to write
  width-generic pretty printers and only pick a width when calling the
  renderer by using this import style:
  ```
  open import Text.Pretty using (Doc; render)
  --                      ^-- no width parameter for Doc & render
  open module Pretty {w} = Text.Pretty w hiding (Doc; render)
  --                 ^-- implicit width parameter for the combinators

  pretty : Doc w
  pretty = ? -- you can use the combinators here and there won't be any
             -- issues related to the fact that `w` cannot be reconstructed
             -- anymore

  main = do
    -- you can now use the same pretty with different widths:
    putStrLn $ render 40 pretty
    putStrLn $ render 80 pretty
  ```

* In `Text.Regex.Search` the `searchND` function finding infix matches has
  been tweaked to make sure the returned solution is a local maximum in terms
  of length. It used to be that we would make the match start as late as
  possible and finish as early as possible. It's now the reverse.

  So `[a-zA-Z]+.agdai?` run on "the path _build/Main.agdai corresponds to"
  will return "Main.agdai" when it used to be happy to just return "n.agda".

### Refactoring of algebraic lattice hierarchy

* In order to improve modularity and consistency with `Relation.Binary.Lattice`,
  the structures & bundles for `Semilattice`, `Lattice`, `DistributiveLattice`
  & `BooleanAlgebra` have been moved out of the `Algebra` modules and into their
  own hierarchy in `Algebra.Lattice`.

* All submodules, (e.g. `Algebra.Properties.Semilattice` or `Algebra.Morphism.Lattice`)
  have been moved to the corresponding place under `Algebra.Lattice` (e.g.
  `Algebra.Lattice.Properties.Semilattice` or `Algebra.Lattice.Morphism.Lattice`). See
  the `Deprecated modules` section below for full details.

* Changed definition of `IsDistributiveLattice` and `IsBooleanAlgebra` so that they are
  no longer right-biased which hinders compositionality. More concretely, `IsDistributiveLattice`
  now has fields:
  ```agda
  ∨-distrib-∧ : ∨ DistributesOver ∧
  ∧-distrib-∨ : ∧ DistributesOver ∨
  ```
  instead of
  ```agda
  ∨-distribʳ-∧ : ∨ DistributesOverʳ ∧
  ```
  and `IsBooleanAlgebra` now has fields:
  ```
  ∨-complement : Inverse ⊤ ¬ ∨
  ∧-complement : Inverse ⊥ ¬ ∧
  ```
  instead of:
  ```agda
  ∨-complementʳ : RightInverse ⊤ ¬ ∨
  ∧-complementʳ : RightInverse ⊥ ¬ ∧
  ```

* To allow construction of these structures via their old form, smart constructors
  have been added to a new module `Algebra.Lattice.Structures.Biased`, which are by
  re-exported automatically by `Algebra.Lattice`. For example, if before you wrote:
  ```agda
  ∧-∨-isDistributiveLattice = record
    { isLattice    = ∧-∨-isLattice
    ; ∨-distribʳ-∧ = ∨-distribʳ-∧
    }
  ```
  you can use the smart constructor `isDistributiveLatticeʳʲᵐ` to write:
  ```agda
  ∧-∨-isDistributiveLattice = isDistributiveLatticeʳʲᵐ (record
    { isLattice    = ∧-∨-isLattice
    ; ∨-distribʳ-∧ = ∨-distribʳ-∧
    })
  ```
  without having to prove full distributivity.

* Added new `IsBoundedSemilattice`/`BoundedSemilattice` records.

* Added new aliases `Is(Meet/Join)(Bounded)Semilattice` for `Is(Bounded)Semilattice`
  which can be used to indicate meet/join-ness of the original structures.

#### Removal of the old function hierarchy

* The switch to the new function hierarchy is complete and the following modules
  have been completely switched over to use the new definitions:
  ```
  Data.Sum.Function.Setoid
  Data.Sum.Function.Propositional
  ```

* Additionally the following proofs now use the new definitions instead of the old ones:
  * `Algebra.Lattice.Properties.BooleanAlgebra`
  * `Algebra.Properties.CommutativeMonoid.Sum`
  * `Algebra.Properties.Lattice`
    * `replace-equality`
  * `Data.Fin.Properties`
    * `∀-cons-⇔`
    * `⊎⇔∃`
  * `Data.Fin.Subset.Properties`
    * `out⊆-⇔`
    * `in⊆in-⇔`
    * `out⊂in-⇔`
    * `out⊂out-⇔`
    * `in⊂in-⇔`
    * `x∈⁅y⁆⇔x≡y`
    * `∩⇔×`
    * `∪⇔⊎`
    * `∃-Subset-[]-⇔`
    * `∃-Subset-∷-⇔`
  * `Data.List.Countdown`
    * `empty`
  * `Data.List.Fresh.Relation.Unary.Any`
    * `⊎⇔Any`
  * `Data.List.NonEmpty`
  * `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Lex`
    * `[]<[]-⇔`
    * `∷<∷-⇔`
  * `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Sublist.Heterogeneous.Properties`
    * `∷⁻¹`
    * `∷ʳ⁻¹`
    * `Sublist-[x]-bijection`
  * `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Sublist.Setoid.Properties`
    * `∷⁻¹`
    * `∷ʳ⁻¹`
    * `[x]⊆xs⤖x∈xs`
  * `Data.List.Relation.Unary.Grouped.Properties`
  * `Data.Maybe.Relation.Binary.Connected`
    * `just-equivalence`
  * `Data.Maybe.Relation.Binary.Pointwise`
    * `just-equivalence`
  * `Data.Maybe.Relation.Unary.All`
    * `just-equivalence`
  * `Data.Maybe.Relation.Unary.Any`
    * `just-equivalence`
  * `Data.Nat.Divisibility`
    * `m%n≡0⇔n∣m`
  * `Data.Nat.Properties`
    * `eq?`
  * `Data.Vec.N-ary`
    * `uncurry-∀ⁿ`
    * `uncurry-∃ⁿ`
  * `Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Lex.Core`
    * `P⇔[]<[]`
    * `∷<∷-⇔`
  * `Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Pointwise.Extensional`
    * `equivalent`
    * `Pointwise-≡↔≡`
  * `Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Pointwise.Inductive`
    * `Pointwise-≡↔≡`
  * `Effect.Monad.Partiality`
    * `correct`
  * `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Reflexive.Properties`
    * `⊎⇔Refl`
  * `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Transitive`
    * `equivalent`
  * `Relation.Binary.Reflection`
    * `solve₁`
  * `Relation.Nullary.Decidable`
    * `map`


#### Changes to the new function hierarchy

* The names of the fields in `Function.Bundles` have been
  changed from `f`, `g`, `cong₁` and `cong₂` to `to`, `from`, `to-cong`, `from-cong`.

* The module `Function.Definitions` no longer has two equalities as module arguments, as
  they did not interact as intended with the re-exports from `Function.Definitions.(Core1/Core2)`.
  The latter have been removed and their definitions folded into `Function.Definitions`.

* In `Function.Definitions` the types of `Surjective`, `Injective` and `Surjective`
  have been changed from:
  ```
  Surjective f = ∀ y → ∃ λ x → f x ≈₂ y
  Inverseˡ f g = ∀ y → f (g y) ≈₂ y
  Inverseʳ f g = ∀ x → g (f x) ≈₁ x
  ```
  to:
  ```
  Surjective f = ∀ y → ∃ λ x → ∀ {z} → z ≈₁ x → f z ≈₂ y
  Inverseˡ f g = ∀ {x y} → y ≈₁ g x → f y ≈₂ x
  Inverseʳ f g = ∀ {x y} → y ≈₂ f x → g y ≈₁ x
  ```
  This is for several reasons: i) the new definitions compose much more easily, ii) Agda
  can better infer the equalities used.

  To ease backwards compatibility:
   - the old definitions have been moved to the new names  `StrictlySurjective`,
         `StrictlyInverseˡ` and `StrictlyInverseʳ`.
   - The records in  `Function.Structures` and `Function.Bundles` export proofs
         of these under the names `strictlySurjective`, `strictlyInverseˡ` and
         `strictlyInverseʳ`,
   - Conversion functions have been added in both directions to
         `Function.Consequences(.Propositional)`.

#### Proofs of non-zeroness/positivity/negativity as instance arguments

* Many numeric operations in the library require their arguments to be non-zero,
  and various proofs require their arguments to be non-zero/positive/negative etc.
  As discussed on the [mailing list](https://lists.chalmers.se/pipermail/agda/2021/012693.html),
  the previous way of constructing and passing round these proofs was extremely clunky and lead
  to messy and difficult to read code. We have therefore changed every occurrence where we need
  a proof of non-zeroness/positivity/etc. to take it as an irrelevant
  [instance argument](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/instance-arguments.html).
  See the mailing list for a fuller explanation of the motivation and implementation.

* For example, whereas the type signature of division used to be:
  ```
  _/_ : (dividend divisor : ℕ) {≢0 : False (divisor ≟ 0)} → ℕ
  ```
  it is now:
  ```
  _/_ : (dividend divisor : ℕ) .{{_ : NonZero divisor}} → ℕ
  ```
  which means that as long as an instance of `NonZero n` is in scope then you can write
  `m / n` without having to explicitly provide a proof, as instance search will fill it in
  for you. The full list of such operations changed is as follows:
    - In `Data.Nat.DivMod`: `_/_`, `_%_`, `_div_`, `_mod_`
    - In `Data.Nat.Pseudorandom.LCG`: `Generator`
    - In `Data.Integer.DivMod`: `_divℕ_`, `_div_`, `_modℕ_`, `_mod_`
    - In `Data.Rational`: `mkℚ+`, `normalize`, `_/_`, `1/_`
    - In `Data.Rational.Unnormalised`: `_/_`, `1/_`, `_÷_`

* At the moment, there are 4 different ways such instance arguments can be provided,
  listed in order of convenience and clarity:
    1. *Automatic basic instances* - the standard library provides instances based on the constructors of each
       numeric type in `Data.X.Base`. For example, `Data.Nat.Base` constrains an instance of `NonZero (suc n)` for any `n`
       and `Data.Integer.Base` contains an instance of `NonNegative (+ n)` for any `n`. Consequently,
       if the argument is of the required form, these instances will always be filled in by instance search
       automatically, e.g.
       ```
       0/n≡0 : 0 / suc n ≡ 0
       ```
    2. *Take the instance as an argument* - You can provide the instance argument as a parameter to your function
       and Agda's instance search will automatically use it in the correct place without you having to
       explicitly pass it, e.g.
       ```
       0/n≡0 : .{{_ : NonZero n}} → 0 / n ≡ 0
       ```
    3. *Define the instance locally* - You can define an instance argument in scope (e.g. in a `where` clause)
       and Agda's instance search will again find it automatically, e.g.
       ```
       instance
         n≢0 : NonZero n
         n≢0 = ...

       0/n≡0 : 0 / n ≡ 0
       ```
    4. *Pass the instance argument explicitly* - Finally, if all else fails you can pass the
       instance argument explicitly into the function using `{{ }}`, e.g.
       ```
       0/n≡0 : ∀ n (n≢0 : NonZero n) → ((0 / n) {{n≢0}}) ≡ 0
       ```
       Suitable constructors for `NonZero`/`Positive` etc. can be found in `Data.X.Base`.

* A full list of proofs that have changed to use instance arguments is available at the end of this file.
  Notable changes to proofs are now discussed below.

* Previously one of the hacks used in proofs was to explicitly refer to everything in the correct form,
  e.g. if the argument `n` had to be non-zero then you would refer to the argument as `suc n` everywhere
  instead of `n`, e.g.
  ```
  n/n≡1 : ∀ n → suc n / suc n ≡ 1
  ```
  This made the proofs extremely difficult to use if your term wasn't in the right form.
  After being updated to use instance arguments instead, the proof above becomes:
  ```
  n/n≡1 : ∀ n {{_ : NonZero n}} → n / n ≡ 1
  ```
  However, note that this means that if you passed in the value `x` to these proofs before, then you
  will now have to pass in `suc x`. The proofs for which the arguments have changed form in this way
  are highlighted in the list at the bottom of the file.

* Finally, the definition of `_≢0` has been removed from `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Base`
  and the following proofs about it have been removed from `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Properties`:
  ```
  p≄0⇒∣↥p∣≢0 : ∀ p → p ≠ 0ℚᵘ → ℤ.∣ (↥ p) ∣ ≢0
  ∣↥p∣≢0⇒p≄0 : ∀ p → ℤ.∣ (↥ p) ∣ ≢0 → p ≠ 0ℚᵘ
  ```
  Instead, a uniform collection, for each of the various possible equality
  relations of the various numeric datatypes, of constructor/destructor pairs
  `-nonZero`/`-nonZero⁻¹` for `NonZero` instances are now defined. 

### Change in reduction behaviour of rationals

* Currently arithmetic expressions involving rationals (both normalised and
  unnormalised) undergo disastrous exponential normalisation. For example,
  `p + q` would often be normalised by Agda to
  `(↥ p ℤ.* ↧ q ℤ.+ ↥ q ℤ.* ↧ p) / (↧ₙ p ℕ.* ↧ₙ q)`. While the normalised form
  of `p + q + r + s + t + u + v` would be ~700 lines long. This behaviour
  often chokes both type-checking and the display of the expressions in the IDE.

* To avoid this expansion and make non-trivial reasoning about rationals actually feasible:
  1. the records `ℚᵘ` and `ℚ` have both had the `no-eta-equality` flag enabled
  2. definition of arithmetic operations have trivial pattern matching added to
     prevent them reducing, e.g.
     ```agda
     p + q = (↥ p ℤ.* ↧ q ℤ.+ ↥ q ℤ.* ↧ p) / (↧ₙ p ℕ.* ↧ₙ q)
     ```
     has been changed to
     ```
     p@record{} + q@record{} = (↥ p ℤ.* ↧ q ℤ.+ ↥ q ℤ.* ↧ p) / (↧ₙ p ℕ.* ↧ₙ q)
     ```

* As a consequence of this, some proofs that relied on this reduction behaviour
  or on eta-equality may no longer go through. There are several ways to fix this:
  1. The principled way is to not rely on this reduction behaviour in the first place.
     The `Properties` files for rational numbers have been greatly expanded in `v1.7`
     and `v2.0`, and we believe most proofs should be able to be built up from existing
     proofs contained within these files.
  2. Alternatively, annotating any rational arguments to a proof with either
     `@record{}` or `@(mkℚ _ _ _)` should restore the old reduction behaviour for any
     terms involving those parameters.
  3. Finally, if the above approaches are not viable then you may be forced to explicitly
     use `cong` combined with a lemma that proves the old reduction behaviour.

### Change to the definition of `LeftCancellative` and `RightCancellative`

* The definitions of the types for cancellativity in `Algebra.Definitions` previously
  made some of their arguments implicit. This was under the assumption that the operators were
  defined by pattern matching on the left argument so that Agda could always infer the
  argument on the RHS.

* Although many of the operators defined in the library follow this convention, this is not
  always true and cannot be assumed in user's code.

* Therefore the definitions have been changed as follows to make all their arguments explicit:
  - `LeftCancellative _•_`
    - From: `∀ x {y z} → (x • y) ≈ (x • z) → y ≈ z`
    - To: `∀ x y z → (x • y) ≈ (x • z) → y ≈ z`

  - `RightCancellative _•_`
    - From: `∀ {x} y z → (y • x) ≈ (z • x) → y ≈ z`
    - To: `∀ x y z → (y • x) ≈ (z • x) → y ≈ z`

* Correspondingly some proofs of the above types will need additional arguments passed explicitly.
  Instances can easily be fixed by adding additional underscores, e.g.
  - `∙-cancelˡ x` to `∙-cancelˡ x _ _`
  - `∙-cancelʳ y z` to `∙-cancelʳ _ y z`

### Change in the definition of `Prime`

* The definition of `Prime` in `Data.Nat.Primality` was:
  ```agda
  Prime 0             = ⊥
  Prime 1             = ⊥
  Prime (suc (suc n)) = (i : Fin n) → 2 + toℕ i ∤ 2 + n
  ```
  which was very hard to reason about as not only did it involve conversion
  to and from the `Fin` type, it also required that the divisor was of the form
  `2 + toℕ i`, which has exactly the same problem as the `suc n` hack described
  above used for non-zeroness.

* To make it easier to use, reason about and read, the definition has been
  changed to:
  ```agda
  Prime 0 = ⊥
  Prime 1 = ⊥
  Prime n = ∀ {d} → 2 ≤ d → d < n → d ∤ n
  ```

### Change to the definition of `Induction.WellFounded.WfRec` (issue #2083)

* Previously, the following definition was adopted
  ```agda
  WfRec : Rel A r → ∀ {ℓ} → RecStruct A ℓ _
  WfRec _<_ P x = ∀ y → y < x → P y
  ```
  with the consequence that all arguments involving about accesibility and
  wellfoundedness proofs were polluted by almost-always-inferrable explicit
  arguments for the `y` position. The definition has now been changed to
  make that argument *implicit*, as 
  ```agda
  WfRec : Rel A r → ∀ {ℓ} → RecStruct A ℓ _
  WfRec _<_ P x = ∀ {y} → y < x → P y
  ```

### Change in the definition of `_≤″_` (issue #1919)

* The definition of `_≤″_` in `Data.Nat.Base` was previously:
  ```agda
  record _≤″_ (m n : ℕ) : Set where
    constructor less-than-or-equal
    field
      {k}   : ℕ
      proof : m + k ≡ n
  ```
  which introduced a spurious additional definition, when this is in fact, modulo
  field names and implicit/explicit qualifiers, equivalent to the definition of left-
  divisibility, `_∣ˡ_` for the `RawMagma` structure of `_+_`. Since the addition of
  raw bundles to `Data.X.Base`, this definition can now be made directly. Knock-on
  consequences include the need to retain the old constructor name, now introduced
  as a pattern synonym, and introduction of (a function equivalent to) the former
  field name/projection function `proof` as `≤″-proof` in `Data.Nat.Properties`.

* Accordingly, the definition has been changed to:
  ```agda
  _≤″_ : (m n : ℕ)  → Set
  _≤″_ = _∣ˡ_ +-rawMagma

  pattern less-than-or-equal {k} prf = k , prf
  ```

### Renaming of `Reflection` modules

* Under the `Reflection` module, there were various impending name clashes
  between the core AST as exposed by Agda and the annotated AST defined in
  the library.

* While the content of the modules remain the same, the modules themselves
  have therefore been renamed as follows:
  ```
  Reflection.Annotated              ↦ Reflection.AnnotatedAST
  Reflection.Annotated.Free         ↦ Reflection.AnnotatedAST.Free

  Reflection.Abstraction            ↦ Reflection.AST.Abstraction
  Reflection.Argument               ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument
  Reflection.Argument.Information   ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument.Information
  Reflection.Argument.Quantity      ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument.Quantity
  Reflection.Argument.Relevance     ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument.Relevance
  Reflection.Argument.Modality      ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument.Modality
  Reflection.Argument.Visibility    ↦ Reflection.AST.Argument.Visibility
  Reflection.DeBruijn               ↦ Reflection.AST.DeBruijn
  Reflection.Definition             ↦ Reflection.AST.Definition
  Reflection.Instances              ↦ Reflection.AST.Instances
  Reflection.Literal                ↦ Reflection.AST.Literal
  Reflection.Meta                   ↦ Reflection.AST.Meta
  Reflection.Name                   ↦ Reflection.AST.Name
  Reflection.Pattern                ↦ Reflection.AST.Pattern
  Reflection.Show                   ↦ Reflection.AST.Show
  Reflection.Traversal              ↦ Reflection.AST.Traversal
  Reflection.Universe               ↦ Reflection.AST.Universe

  Reflection.TypeChecking.Monad             ↦ Reflection.TCM
  Reflection.TypeChecking.Monad.Categorical ↦ Reflection.TCM.Categorical
  Reflection.TypeChecking.Monad.Format      ↦ Reflection.TCM.Format
  Reflection.TypeChecking.Monad.Syntax      ↦ Reflection.TCM.Instances
  Reflection.TypeChecking.Monad.Instances   ↦ Reflection.TCM.Syntax
  ```

* A new module `Reflection.AST` that re-exports the contents of the
  submodules has been added.

### Implementation of division and modulus for `ℤ`

* The previous implementations of `_divℕ_`, `_div_`, `_modℕ_`, `_mod_`
  in `Data.Integer.DivMod` internally converted to the unary `Fin` datatype
  resulting in poor performance. The implementation has been updated to
  use the corresponding operations from `Data.Nat.DivMod` which are
  efficiently implemented using the Haskell backend.

### Strict functions

* The module `Strict` has been deprecated in favour of `Function.Strict`
  and the definitions of strict application, `_$!_` and `_$!′_`, have been
  moved from `Function.Base` to `Function.Strict`.

* The contents of `Function.Strict` is now re-exported by `Function`.

### Changes to ring structures

* Several ring-like structures now have the multiplicative structure defined by
  its laws rather than as a substructure, to avoid repeated proofs that the
  underlying relation is an equivalence. These are:
  * `IsNearSemiring`
  * `IsSemiringWithoutOne`
  * `IsSemiringWithoutAnnihilatingZero`
  * `IsRing`
* To aid with migration, structures matching the old style ones have been added
  to `Algebra.Structures.Biased`, with conversion functions:
  * `IsNearSemiring*` and `isNearSemiring*`
  * `IsSemiringWithoutOne*` and `isSemiringWithoutOne*`
  * `IsSemiringWithoutAnnihilatingZero*` and `isSemiringWithoutAnnihilatingZero*`
  * `IsRing*` and `isRing*`

### Proof-irrelevant empty type

* The definition of ⊥ has been changed to
  ```agda
  private
    data Empty : Set where

  ⊥ : Set
  ⊥ = Irrelevant Empty
  ```
  in order to make ⊥ proof irrelevant. Any two proofs of `⊥` or of a negated
  statements are now *judgmentally* equal to each other.

* Consequently we have modified the following definitions:
  + In `Relation.Nullary.Decidable.Core`, the type of `dec-no` has changed
    ```agda
    dec-no : (p? : Dec P) → ¬ P → ∃ λ ¬p′ → p? ≡ no ¬p′
      ↦ dec-no : (p? : Dec P) (¬p : ¬ P) → p? ≡ no ¬p
    ```
  + In `Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality`, the type of `≢-≟-identity` has changed
    ```agda
    ≢-≟-identity : x ≢ y → ∃ λ ¬eq → x ≟ y ≡ no ¬eq
      ↦ ≢-≟-identity : (x≢y : x ≢ y) → x ≟ y ≡ no x≢y
    ```

### Reorganisation of the `Relation.Nullary` hierarchy

* It was very difficult to use the `Relation.Nullary` modules, as `Relation.Nullary`
  contained the basic definitions of negation, decidability etc., and the operations and
  proofs were smeared over `Relation.Nullary.(Negation/Product/Sum/Implication etc.)`.

* In order to fix this:
  - the definition of `Dec` and `recompute` have been moved to `Relation.Nullary.Decidable.Core`
  - the definition of `Reflects` has been moved to `Relation.Nullary.Reflects`
  - the definition of `¬_` has been moved to `Relation.Nullary.Negation.Core`

* Backwards compatibility has been maintained, as `Relation.Nullary` still re-exports these publicly.

* The modules:
  ```
  Relation.Nullary.Product
  Relation.Nullary.Sum
  Relation.Nullary.Implication
  ```
  have been deprecated and their contents moved to `Relation.Nullary.(Negation/Reflects/Decidable)`
  however all their contents is re-exported by `Relation.Nullary` which is the easiest way to access
  it now.

* In order to facilitate this reorganisation the following breaking moves have occurred:
  - `¬?` has been moved from `Relation.Nullary.Negation.Core` to `Relation.Nullary.Decidable.Core`
  - `¬-reflects` has been moved from `Relation.Nullary.Negation.Core` to `Relation.Nullary.Reflects`.
  - `decidable-stable`, `excluded-middle` and `¬-drop-Dec` have been moved from `Relation.Nullary.Negation`
    to `Relation.Nullary.Decidable`.
  - `fromDec` and `toDec` have been moved from `Data.Sum.Base` to `Data.Sum`.

### Refactoring of the unindexed Functor/Applicative/Monad hierarchy

* The unindexed versions are not defined in terms of the named versions anymore

* The `RawApplicative` and `RawMonad` type classes have been relaxed so that the underlying
  functors do not need their domain and codomain to live at the same Set level.
  This is needed for level-increasing functors like `IO : Set l → Set (suc l)`.

* `RawApplicative` is now `RawFunctor + pure + _<*>_` and `RawMonad` is now
  `RawApplicative` + `_>>=_` and so `return` is not used anywhere anymore.
  This fixes the conflict with `case_return_of` (#356)
  This reorganisation means in particular that the functor/applicative of a monad
  are not computed using `_>>=_`. This may break proofs.

* When `F : Set f → Set f` we moreover have a definable join/μ operator
  `join : (M : RawMonad F) → F (F A) → F A`.

* We now have `RawEmpty` and `RawChoice` respectively packing `empty : M A` and
  `(<|>) : M A → M A → M A`. `RawApplicativeZero`, `RawAlternative`, `RawMonadZero`,
  `RawMonadPlus` are all defined in terms of these.

* `MonadT T` now returns a `MonadTd` record that packs both a proof that the
  `Monad M` transformed by `T` is a monad and that we can `lift` a computation
  `M A` to a transformed computation `T M A`.

* The monad transformer are not mere aliases anymore, they are record-wrapped
  which allows constraints such as `MonadIO (StateT S (ReaderT R IO))` to be
  discharged by instance arguments.

* The mtl-style type classes (`MonadState`, `MonadReader`) do not contain a proof
  that the underlying functor is a `Monad` anymore. This ensures we do not have
  conflicting `Monad M` instances from a pair of `MonadState S M` & `MonadReader R M`
  constraints.

* `MonadState S M` is now defined in terms of
  ```agda
  gets : (S → A) → M A
  modify : (S → S) → M ⊤
  ```
  with `get` and `put` defined as derived notions.
  This is needed because `MonadState S M` does not pack a `Monad M` instance anymore
  and so we cannot define `modify f` as `get >>= λ s → put (f s)`.

* `MonadWriter 𝕎 M` is defined similarly:
   ```agda
   writer : W × A → M A
   listen : M A → M (W × A)
   pass   : M ((W → W) × A) → M A
   ```
   with `tell` defined as a derived notion.
   Note that `𝕎` is a `RawMonoid`, not a `Set` and `W` is the carrier of the monoid.

* New modules:
  ```
  Algebra.Construct.Initial
  Algebra.Construct.Terminal
  Data.List.Effectful.Transformer
  Data.List.NonEmpty.Effectful.Transformer
  Data.Maybe.Effectful.Transformer
  Data.Sum.Effectful.Left.Transformer
  Data.Sum.Effectful.Right.Transformer

  ```
### (Issue #2096) Introduction of flipped relation symbol for `Relation.Binary.Bundles.Preorder`

* Previously, the relation symbol `_∼_`  was (notationally) symmetric, so that its
  converse relation could only be discussed *semantically* in terms of `flip _∼_`
  in `Relation.Binary.Properties.Preorder`, `Relation.Binary.Construct.Flip.{Ord|EqAndOrd}`

* Now, the symbol `_∼_` has been renamed to a new symbol `_≲_`, with `_≳_`
  introduced as a definition in `Relation.Binary.Bundles.Preorder` whose properties
  in `Relation.Binary.Properties.Preorder` now refer to it. Partial backwards compatible
  has been achieved by redeclaring a deprecated version of the old name in the record.
  Therefore, only _declarations_ of `PartialOrder` records will need their field names
  updating.

### (Issue #1214) Reorganisation of the introduction of negated relation symbols under `Relation.Binary`

* Previously, negated relation symbols `_≰_` (for `Poset`) and `_≮_` (`TotalOrder`)
  were introduced in the corresponding `Relation.Binary.Properties` modules, for re-export.

* Now they are introduced as definitions in the corresponding `Relation.Binary.Bundles`,
  together with, for uniformity's sake, an additional negated symbol `_⋦_` for `Preorder`,
  with their (obvious) intended semantics:
  ```agda
  infix 4 _⋦_ _≰_ _≮_
  Preorder._⋦_            : Rel Carrier _
  StrictPartialOrder._≮_  : Rel Carrier _
  ```
  Additionally, `Poset._≰_` is defined by renaming public export of `Preorder._⋦_`

* Backwards compatibility has been maintained, with deprecated definitions in the
  corresponding `Relation.Binary.Properties` modules, and the corresponding client
  client module `import`s being adjusted accordingly.


### Standardisation of `insertAt`/`updateAt`/`removeAt`

* Previously, the names and argument order of index-based insertion, update and removal functions for
  various types of lists and vectors were inconsistent.

* To fix this the names have all been standardised to `insertAt`/`updateAt`/`removeAt`.

* Correspondingly the following changes have occurred:

* In `Data.List.Base` the following have been added:
  ```agda
  insertAt : (xs : List A) → Fin (suc (length xs)) → A → List A
  updateAt : (xs : List A) → Fin (length xs) → (A → A) → List A
  removeAt : (xs : List A) → Fin (length xs) → List A
  ```
  and the following has been deprecated
  ```
  _─_ ↦ removeAt
  ```

* In `Data.Vec.Base`:
  ```agda
  insert ↦ insertAt
  remove ↦ removeAt

  updateAt : Fin n → (A → A) → Vec A n → Vec A n
    ↦
  updateAt : Vec A n → Fin n → (A → A) → Vec A n
  ```

* In `Data.Vec.Functional`:
  ```agda
  remove : Fin (suc n) → Vector A (suc n) → Vector A n
    ↦
  removeAt : Vector A (suc n) → Fin (suc n) → Vector A n

  updateAt : Fin n → (A → A) → Vector A n → Vector A n
    ↦
  updateAt : Vector A n → Fin n → (A → A) → Vector A n
  ```

* The old names (and the names of all proofs about these functions) have been deprecated appropriately.

### Changes to triple reasoning interface

* The module `Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Base.Triple` now takes an extra proof that the strict
  relation is irreflexive.

* This allows the following new proof combinator:
  ```agda
  begin-contradiction : (r : x IsRelatedTo x) → {s : True (IsStrict? r)} → A
  ```
  that takes a proof that a value is strictly less than itself and then applies the principle of explosion.

* Specialised versions of this combinator are available in the following derived modules:
  ```
  Data.Nat.Properties
  Data.Nat.Binary.Properties
  Data.Integer.Properties
  Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Properties
  Data.Rational.Properties
  Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Lex.Strict
  Data.Vec.Relation.Binary.Lex.NonStrict
  Relation.Binary.Reasoning.StrictPartialOrder
  Relation.Binary.Reasoning.PartialOrder
  ```	

### Other

* In accordance with changes to the flags in Agda 2.6.3, all modules that previously used
  the `--without-K` flag now use the `--cubical-compatible` flag instead.

* To avoid _large indices_ that are by default no longer allowed in Agda 2.6.4,
  universe levels have been increased in the following definitions:
  - `Data.Star.Decoration.DecoratedWith`
  - `Data.Star.Pointer.Pointer`
  - `Reflection.AnnotatedAST.Typeₐ`
  - `Reflection.AnnotatedAST.AnnotationFun`

* The first two arguments of `m≡n⇒m-n≡0` (now `i≡j⇒i-j≡0`) in `Data.Integer.Base`
  have been made implicit.

* The relations `_≤_` `_≥_` `_<_` `_>_` in `Data.Fin.Base` have been
  generalised so they can now relate `Fin` terms with different indices.
  Should be mostly backwards compatible, but very occasionally when proving
  properties about the orderings themselves the second index must be provided
  explicitly.

* The argument `xs` in `xs≮[]` in `Data.{List|Vec}.Relation.Binary.Lex.Strict`
  introduced in PRs #1648 and #1672 has now been made implicit.

* Issue #2075 (Johannes Waldmann): wellfoundedness of the lexicographic ordering
  on products, defined in `Data.Product.Relation.Binary.Lex.Strict`, no longer
  requires the assumption of symmetry for the first equality relation `_≈₁_`,
  leading to a new lemma `Induction.WellFounded.Acc-resp-flip-≈`, and refactoring
  of the previous proof `Induction.WellFounded.Acc-resp-≈`.

* The operation `SymClosure` on relations in
  `Relation.Binary.Construct.Closure.Symmetric` has been reimplemented
  as a data type `SymClosure _⟶_ a b` that is parameterized by the
  input relation `_⟶_` (as well as the elements `a` and `b` of the
  domain) so that `_⟶_` can be inferred, which it could not from the
  previous implementation using the sum type `a ⟶ b ⊎ b ⟶ a`.

* In `Algebra.Morphism.Structures`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`,
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism`, and `IsRingHomomorphism` have been redesigned to
  build up from `IsMonoidHomomorphism`, `IsNearSemiringHomomorphism`, and
  `IsSemiringHomomorphism` respectively, adding a single property at each step.
  This means that they no longer need to have two separate proofs of
  `IsRelHomomorphism`. Similarly, `IsLatticeHomomorphism` is now built as
  `IsRelHomomorphism` along with proofs that `_∧_` and `_∨_` are homomorphic.

  Also, `⁻¹-homo` in `IsRingHomomorphism` has been renamed to `-‿homo`.

* Moved definition of `_>>=_` under `Data.Vec.Base` to its submodule `CartesianBind`
  in order to keep another new definition of `_>>=_`, located in `DiagonalBind`
  which is also a submodule of `Data.Vec.Base`.

* The functions `split`, `flatten` and `flatten-split` have been removed from
  `Data.List.NonEmpty`. In their place `groupSeqs` and `ungroupSeqs`
  have been added to `Data.List.NonEmpty.Base` which morally perform the same
  operations but without computing the accompanying proofs. The proofs can be
  found in `Data.List.NonEmpty.Properties` under the names `groupSeqs-groups`
  and `ungroupSeqs` and `groupSeqs`.

* In `Data.List.Relation.Unary.Grouped.Properties` the proofs `map⁺` and `map⁻`
  have had their preconditions weakened so the equivalences no longer require congruence
  proofs.

* The constructors `+0` and `+[1+_]` from `Data.Integer.Base` are no longer
  exported by `Data.Rational.Base`. You will have to open `Data.Integer(.Base)`
  directly to use them.

* The names of the (in)equational reasoning combinators defined in the internal
  modules `Data.Rational(.Unnormalised).Properties.≤-Reasoning` have been renamed
  (issue #1437) to conform with the defined setoid equality `_≃_` on `Rational`s:
  ```agda
  step-≈  ↦  step-≃
  step-≈˘ ↦  step-≃˘
  ```
  with corresponding associated syntax:
  ```agda
  _≈⟨_⟩_  ↦  _≃⟨_⟩_
  _≈˘⟨_⟩_ ↦  _≃˘⟨_⟩_
  ```
  NB. It is not possible to rename or deprecate `syntax` declarations, so Agda will
  only issue a "Could not parse the application `begin ...` when scope checking"
  warning if the old combinators are used.

* The types of the proofs `pos⇒1/pos`/`1/pos⇒pos` and `neg⇒1/neg`/`1/neg⇒neg` in
  `Data.Rational(.Unnormalised).Properties` have been switched, as the previous
  naming scheme didn't correctly generalise to e.g. `pos+pos⇒pos`. For example
  the types of `pos⇒1/pos`/`1/pos⇒pos` were:
  ```
  pos⇒1/pos : ∀ p .{{_ : NonZero p}} .{{Positive (1/ p)}} → Positive p
  1/pos⇒pos : ∀ p .{{_ : Positive p}} → Positive (1/ p)
  ```
  but are now:
  ```
  pos⇒1/pos : ∀ p .{{_ : Positive p}} → Positive (1/ p)
  1/pos⇒pos : ∀ p .{{_ : NonZero p}} .{{Positive (1/ p)}} → Positive p
  ```
* `Opₗ` and `Opᵣ` have moved from `Algebra.Core` to `Algebra.Module.Core`.

* In `Data.Nat.GeneralisedArithmetic`, the `s` and `z` arguments to the following
  functions have been made explicit:
  * `fold-+`
  * `fold-k`
  * `fold-*`
  * `fold-pull`

* In `Data.Fin.Properties`:
  + the `i` argument to `opposite-suc` has been made explicit;
  + `pigeonhole` has been strengthened: wlog, we return a proof that
    `i < j` rather than a mere `i ≢ j`.

* In `Data.Sum.Base` the definitions `fromDec` and `toDec` have been moved to `Data.Sum`.

* In `Data.Vec.Base`: the definitions `init` and `last` have been changed from the `initLast`
  view-derived implementation to direct recursive definitions.

* In `Codata.Guarded.Stream` the following functions have been modified to have simpler definitions:
  * `cycle`
  * `interleave⁺`
  * `cantor`
  Furthermore, the direction of interleaving of `cantor` has changed. Precisely, suppose `pair` is the cantor pairing function, then `lookup (pair i j) (cantor xss)` according to the old definition corresponds to `lookup (pair j i) (cantor xss)` according to the new definition. For a concrete example see the one included at the end of the module.

* Removed `m/n/o≡m/[n*o]` from `Data.Nat.Divisibility` and added a more general
  `m/n/o≡m/[n*o]` to `Data.Nat.DivMod` that doesn't require `n * o ∣ m`.

* Updated `lookup` functions (and variants) to match the conventions adopted in the
  `List` module i.e. `lookup` takes its container first and the index (whose type may
  depend on the container value) second.
  This affects modules:
  ```
  Codata.Guarded.Stream
  Codata.Guarded.Stream.Relation.Binary.Pointwise
  Codata.Musical.Colist.Base
  Codata.Musical.Colist.Relation.Unary.Any.Properties
  Codata.Musical.Covec
  Codata.Musical.Stream
  Codata.Sized.Colist
  Codata.Sized.Covec
  Codata.Sized.Stream
  Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.All
  Data.Star.Environment
  Data.Star.Pointer
  Data.Star.Vec
  Data.Trie
  Data.Trie.NonEmpty
  Data.Tree.AVL
  Data.Tree.AVL.Indexed
  Data.Tree.AVL.Map
  Data.Tree.AVL.NonEmpty
  Data.Vec.Recursive
  Tactic.RingSolver
  Tactic.RingSolver.Core.NatSet
  ```

* Moved & renamed from `Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.All`
  to `Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.All.Properties`:
  ```
  lookup ↦ lookup⁺
  tabulate ↦ lookup⁻
  ```

* Renamed in `Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.Linked.Properties`
  and `Codata.Guarded.Stream.Relation.Binary.Pointwise`:
  ```
  lookup ↦ lookup⁺
  ```

* Added the following new definitions to `Data.Vec.Relation.Unary.All`:
  ```
  lookupAny : All P xs → (i : Any Q xs) → (P ∩ Q) (Any.lookup i)
  lookupWith : ∀[ P ⇒ Q ⇒ R ] → All P xs → (i : Any Q xs) → R (Any.lookup i)
  lookup : All P xs → (∀ {x} → x ∈ₚ xs → P x)
  lookupₛ : P Respects _≈_ → All P xs → (∀ {x} → x ∈ xs → P x)
  ```

* `excluded-middle` in `Relation.Nullary.Decidable.Core` has been renamed to
  `¬¬-excluded-middle`.

* `iterate` and `replicate` in `Data.Vec.Base` and `Data.Vec.Functional` 
  now take the length of vector, `n`, as an explicit rather than an implicit argument.
  ```agda
  iterate : (A → A) → A → ∀ n → Vec A n
  replicate : ∀ n → A → Vec A n
  ```

Major improvements
------------------

### Improvements to ring solver tactic

* The ring solver tactic has been greatly improved. In particular:
  1. When the solver is used for concrete ring types, e.g. ℤ, the equality can now use
     all the ring operations defined natively for that type, rather than having
     to use the operations defined in `AlmostCommutativeRing`. For example
     previously you could not use `Data.Integer.Base._*_` but instead had to
     use `AlmostCommutativeRing._*_`.
  2. The solver now supports use of the subtraction operator `_-_` whenever
     it is defined immediately in terms of `_+_` and `-_`. This is the case for
     `Data.Integer` and `Data.Rational`.

### Moved `_%_` and `_/_` operators to `Data.Nat.Base`

* Previously the division and modulus operators were defined in `Data.Nat.DivMod`
  which in turn meant that using them required importing `Data.Nat.Properties`
  which is a very heavy dependency.

* To fix this, these operators have been moved to `Data.Nat.Base`. The properties
  for them still live in `Data.Nat.DivMod` (which also publicly re-exports them
  to provide backwards compatibility).

* Beneficiaries of this change include `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Base` whose
  dependencies are now significantly smaller.

### Moved raw bundles from Data.X.Properties to Data.X.Base

* As mentioned by MatthewDaggitt in Issue #1755, Raw bundles defined in Data.X.Properties
  should be defined in Data.X.Base as they don't require any properties.
  * Moved raw bundles From `Data.Nat.Properties` to `Data.Nat.Base`
  * Moved raw bundles From `Data.Nat.Binary.Properties` to `Data.Nat.Binary.Base`
  * Moved raw bundles From `Data.Rational.Properties` to `Data.Rational.Base`
  * Moved raw bundles From `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Properties` to `Data.Rational.Unnormalised.Base`

### Moved the definition of RawX from `Algebra.X.Bundles` to `Algebra.X.Bundles.Raw`

* A new module `Algebra.Bundles.Raw` containing the definitions of the raw bundles
  can be imported at much lower cost from `Data.X.Base`.
  The following definitions have been moved:
  * `RawMagma`
  * `RawMonoid`
  * `RawGroup`
  * `RawNearSemiring`
  * `RawSemiring`
  * `RawRingWithoutOne`
  * `RawRing`
  * `RawQuasigroup`
  * `RawLoop`
  * `RawKleeneAlgebra`
* A new module `Algebra.Lattice.Bundles.Raw` is also introduced.
  * `RawLattice` has been moved from `Algebra.Lattice.Bundles` to this new module.

* In `Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Base.Triple`, added a new parameter `<-irrefl : Irreflexive _≈_ _<_`

Deprecated modules
------------------

### Moving `Relation.Binary.Construct.(Converse/Flip)`

* The following files have been moved:
  ```agda
  Relation.Binary.Construct.Converse               ↦ Relation.Binary.Construct.Flip.EqAndOrd
  Relation.Binary.Construct.Flip                   ↦ Relation.Binary.Construct.Flip.Ord
  ```

### Deprecation of old function hierarchy

* The module `Function.Related` has been deprecated in favour of `Function.Related.Propositional`
  whose code uses the new function hierarchy. This also opens up the possibility of a more
  general `Function.Related.Setoid` at a later date. Several of the names have been changed
  in this process to bring them into line with the camelcase naming convention used
  in the rest of the library:
  ```agda
  reverse-implication ↦ reverseImplication
  reverse-injection   ↦ reverseInjection
  left-inverse        ↦ leftInverse

  Symmetric-kind      ↦ SymmetricKind
  Forward-kind        ↦ ForwardKind
  Backward-kind       ↦ BackwardKind
  Equivalence-kind    ↦ EquivalenceKind
  ```

### Moving `Algebra.Lattice` files

* As discussed above the following files have been moved:
  ```agda

  ```

### Moving `Relation.Binary.Properties.XLattice` files

* The following files have been moved:
  ```agda

### Deprecation of `Data.Nat.Properties.Core`

* The module `Data.Nat.Properties.Core` has been deprecated, and its one lemma moved to `Data.Nat.Base`, renamed as `s≤s⁻¹`

### Deprecation of `Data.Fin.Substitution.Example`

* The module `Data.Fin.Substitution.Example` has been deprecated, and moved to `README.Data.Fin.Substitution.UntypedLambda`

### Deprecation of `Data.Product.Function.Dependent.Setoid.WithK`

* This module has been deprecated, as none of its contents actually depended on axiom K. The contents has been moved to `Data.Product.Function.Dependent.Setoid`.

Deprecated names
----------------

* In `Algebra.Construct.Zero`:
  ```agda
  rawMagma   ↦  Algebra.Construct.Terminal.rawMagma
  magma      ↦  Algebra.Construct.Terminal.magma
  semigroup  ↦  Algebra.Construct.Terminal.semigroup
  band       ↦  Algebra.Construct.Terminal.band
  ```

* In `Codata.Guarded.Stream.Properties`:
  ```agda
  map-identity  ↦  map-id
  map-fusion    ↦  map-∘
  drop-fusion   ↦  drop-drop
  ```

* In `Codata.Sized.Colist.Properties`:
  ```agda
  map-identity      ↦  map-id
  map-map-fusion    ↦  map-∘
  drop-drop-fusion  ↦  drop-drop
  ```

* In `Codata.Sized.Covec.Properties`:
  ```agda
  map-identity   ↦  map-id
  map-map-fusion  ↦  map-∘
  ```

* In `Codata.Sized.Delay.Properties`:
  ```agda
  map-identity      ↦  map-id
  map-map-fusion    ↦  map-∘
  map-unfold-fusion  ↦  map-unfold
  ```

* In `Codata.Sized.M.Properties`:
  ```agda

  ```

* In `Codata.Sized.Stream.Properties`:
  ```agda
  map-identity   ↦  map-id
  map-map-fusion  ↦  map-∘
  ```

* In `Data.Bool.Properties` (Issue #2046):
  ```
  push-function-into-if ↦ if-float
  ```

* In `Data.Container.Related`:
  ```
  _∼[_]_  ↦  _≲[_]_
  ```

* In `Data.Fin.Base`: two new, hopefully more memorable, names `↑ˡ` `↑ʳ`
  for the 'left', resp. 'right' injection of a Fin m into a 'larger' type,
  `Fin (m + n)`, resp. `Fin (n + m)`, with argument order to reflect the
  position of the `Fin m` argument.
  ```
  inject+  ↦  flip _↑ˡ_
  raise    ↦  _↑ʳ_
  ```

  Issue #1726: the relation `_≺_` and its single constructor `_≻toℕ_`
  have been deprecated in favour of their extensional equivalent `_<_`
  but omitting the inversion principle which pattern matching on `_≻toℕ_`
  would achieve; this instead is proxied by the property `Data.Fin.Properties.toℕ<`.

* In `Data.Fin.Induction`:
  ```
  ≺-Rec
  ≺-wellFounded
  ≺-recBuilder
  ≺-rec
  ```

  As with Issue #1726 above: the deprecation of relation `_≺_` means that these definitions
  associated with wf-recursion are deprecated in favour of their `_<_` counterparts.
  But it's not quite sensible to say that these definitions should be *renamed* to *anything*,
  least of all those counterparts... the type confusion would be intolerable.

* In `Data.Fin.Properties`:
  ```
  toℕ-raise        ↦ toℕ-↑ʳ
  toℕ-inject+      ↦ toℕ-↑ˡ
  splitAt-inject+  ↦ splitAt-↑ˡ m i n
  splitAt-raise    ↦ splitAt-↑ʳ
  Fin0↔⊥           ↦ 0↔⊥
  eq?              ↦ inj⇒≟
  ```

  Likewise under issue #1726: the properties `≺⇒<′` and `<′⇒≺` have been deprecated
  in favour of their proxy counterparts `<⇒<′` and `<′⇒<`.

* In `Data.Fin.Permutation.Components`:
  ```
  reverse            ↦ Data.Fin.Base.opposite
  reverse-prop       ↦ Data.Fin.Properties.opposite-prop
  reverse-involutive ↦ Data.Fin.Properties.opposite-involutive
  reverse-suc        ↦ Data.Fin.Properties.opposite-suc
  ```

* In `Data.Integer.DivMod` the operator names have been renamed to
  be consistent with those in `Data.Nat.DivMod`:
  ```
  _divℕ_  ↦ _/ℕ_
  _div_   ↦ _/_
  _modℕ_  ↦ _%ℕ_
  _mod_   ↦ _%_
  ```

* In `Data.Integer.Properties` references to variables in names have
  been made consistent so that `m`, `n` always refer to naturals and
  `i` and `j` always refer to integers:
