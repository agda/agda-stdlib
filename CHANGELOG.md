Version 2.4-dev
===============

The library has been tested using Agda 2.8.0.

Highlights
----------

Bug-fixes
---------

* Fix a type error in `README.Data.Fin.Relation.Unary.Top` within the definition of `>-weakInduction`.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

Minor improvements
------------------

* The type of `Relation.Nullary.Negation.Core.contradiction-irr` has been further
  weakened so that the negated hypothesis `¬ A` is marked as irrelevant. This is
  safe to do, in view of `Relation.Nullary.Recomputable.Properties.¬-recompute`.

* Similarly type of `Data.Fin.Base.punchOut` has been weakened so that the negated
  equational hypothesis `i ≢ j` is marked as irrelevant. This simplifies some of
  the proofs of its properties, but also requires some slightly more explicit
  instantiation in a couple of places.

* Refactored usages of `+-∸-assoc 1` to `∸-suc` in:
  ```agda
  README.Data.Fin.Relation.Unary.Top
  Algebra.Properties.Semiring.Binomial
  Data.Fin.Subset.Properties
  Data.Nat.Binary.Subtraction
  Data.Nat.Combinatorics
  ```

Deprecated modules
------------------

Deprecated names
----------------

New modules
-----------

Additions to existing modules
-----------------------------

* In `Data.Nat.Properties`:
  ```agda
  ∸-suc : m ≤ n → suc n ∸ m ≡ suc (n ∸ m)
  ```
