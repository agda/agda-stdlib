# Summary

Agda [@agda2024manual] is a dependently-typed functional
language that serves as both a programming language
and an interactive theorem prover (ITP).
More precisely, one can formulate requirements on programs as types, and building programs satisfying these requirements is performed in a fundamentally interactive manner.
The Curry-Howard lens [@DBLP:journals/cacm/Wadler15], types and terms can be seen as theorems and their proofs.

We present the Agda standard library [@agda-stdlib-v2.0], hereafter referred to as `agda-stdlib`, which provides definitions intended to be generally helpful in developments of programs and proofs.
Unlike standard libraries of traditional programming languages, `agda-stdlib` provides not only standard utilities and data structures, but also a range of basic discrete mathematics useful for proving the correctness of programs.

# Statement of need

There are two reasons why a standard library for Agda is different than for traditional languages.

First, Agda's language is small but sufficient to define many concepts usually considered part of a language (such
as the notion of an integer).
This reduces compiler complexity. But it increases the need for a standard library.

Second, as correctness is an important goal of most Agda users, it is important that functions provided by `agda-stdlib` come with correctness guarantees. Such proofs often require significant effort which should not be downloaded to users.

# Impact

A wide range of projects make use of `agda-stdlib`.
Here is a selection:

- Programming Language Foundations in Agda [@plfa22.08]

- Formalisation of category theory [@hu2021categories]

- Intrinsically typed interpreters for imperative languages [@bach2017intrinsically] and formalisation of type-level computation and subtyping in Scala [@stucki2021theory]

- Formally verified calculus for the synchronous, reactive programming language Esterel [@florence2019esterel]

- Verification of hardware circuit design [@pizani2018pi]

- Verification of routing protocols [@daggitt2023routing]

`agda-stdlib` has also been used as a test bed for the design of co-inductive data types in Agda itself, resulting having in three different notions.

The development of `agda-stdlib` has also had a synergistic relationship with that of Agda itself, prompting new language features.
Firstly, Agda supports a wide range of possibly incompatible language extensions.
Examples include `--cubical` (changing the underlying type theory to cubical type theory [@DBLP:journals/jfp/VezzosiMA21]),
`--with-K` (adding support for Streicher's axiom K [@streicher1993investigations], with incompatible with the `--cubical`-enabled type theory),
or `--safe` (an ITP-oriented option enforcing that nothing is postulated and disabling parts of the FFI mechanism).
In order for `agda-stdlib` to be compatible with as many different variants as possible, we designed the library in units
requesting the minimal expressive power needed.
Thus Agda's language options were categorised as "infective", "coinfective" or "neither".
"infection" options impact all the import*ing* modules (example: `--with-K`). 
"coinfective" options affect the import*ed* modules (example: `--safe`).
Another feature motivated by of `agda-stdlib` is attaching custom messages to definitions, displayed on use.
This enabled deprecation warnings, easing the evolution of user code.

# Design Challenges

Organising libraries of discrete mathematics and algebra into a coherent and logical structure is notoriously difficult
[@carette2020leveraging] [@cohen2020hierarchy].
There is a tension between organising the material to be as general as possible and providing direct and intuitive definitions.
Mathematical objects often permit multiple representations with varying application-specific usability profiles -- but this leads to redundancy/duplication.
Some theorem provers ([@coq2024manual], [@paulson1994isabelle]) choose instead to have a rich ecosystem of external libraries, reducing the pressure to have canonical definitions for common concepts at the risk of incompatibilities between libraries.
We have chosen, like Lean's `mathlib` [@van2020maintaining], to provide a repository of canonical definitions.

`agda-stdlib` has embraced the "intrinsic style" of dependent types, in which correctness invariants are part of the data structures themselves.
For instance, the definition of rational numbers carries a proof showing that the numerator and denominator have no common factors.
The intrinsic style also means returning proofs from decision procedures rather than booleans.
We believe that `agda-stdlib` has been one of the first standard libraries to tackle this challenge.

Agda's parametrized modules which also embrace dependent types [@ivardeBruin2023] are used heavily.
This contrasts with other language which instead rely on type classes for similar functionality.
This lets users specify in a single location how to instantiate all the abstract module parameters and reduces the overhead of instance search.
A drawback is the need for qualified imports when instantiating code twice in the same scope.
Another benefit is ability to safely and scalably embed non-constructive mathematics into a primarily constructive library.

# Testing

Correctness proofs do not entirely obviate the need for testing.
There are tests for two critical areas: first functions that use features that cannot be reasoned about internally (such as the FFI and tactics implemented as macros); second, performance tests.
However the test suite's coverage is incomplete as this is not a priority for the community.

# Notable improvements in version 2.0

The current developers believe that `agda-stdlib` version 2.0 [@agda-stdlib-v2.0] has successfully addressed some of the
design flaws and missing functionality of previous versions, including:

- Minimised Dependency Graphs: the most commonly used modules rely on fewer parts of the library, resulting in faster load and compilation times in general.

- Standardisation: Mathematical objects such as groups, rings, orders, equivalences, etc., and their morphisms are now uniformly constructed from their sub-objects, enhancing consistency and usability.

- Tactics Library: We have more tactics but experiments suggest that they are currently slower than those in comparable systems.

- Testing Framework: We have introduced a golden testing framework to let users write their own test suites.
