# Summary

Agda [@agda2024manual] is a dependently-typed functional language that serves as both a programming language and an interactive theorem prover (ITP).
In Agda, one can formulate requirements on programs as types, and build programs satisfying these requirements interactively.
The Curry-Howard correspondance [@DBLP:journals/cacm/Wadler15] allows types and programs to be seen as theorems and proofs.

We present the Agda standard library [@agda-stdlib-v2.0] (`agda-stdlib`), which provides definitions helpful in the development of programs and proofs.
Unlike standard libraries of traditional programming languages, `agda-stdlib` provides not only standard utilities and data structures, but also basic discrete mathematics useful for proving the correctness of programs.

# Statement of need

Aside from the normal justifications for the existence of standard libraries, there are two reasons why `agda-stdlib` is uniquely needed.

First, Agda as a language is small and does not include concepts usually considered part of a language (such as integers and strings).
This reduces compiler complexity, but means that `agda-stdlib` must define such concepts itself.

Second, as program correctness is important for most Agda users, the functions provided by `agda-stdlib` come with correctness guarantees. Such proofs often require significant effort which should not be offloaded to users.

# Impact

A wide range of projects make use of `agda-stdlib`, including:

- Programming Language Foundations in Agda [@plfa22.08]

- Formalisation of category theory [@hu2021categories]

- Formalisation of aspects of Scala's type system [@stucki2021theory]

- Verification of a calculus for the synchronous, reactive Esterel language [@florence2019esterel]

- Verification of hardware circuit design [@pizani2018pi]

- Verification of routing protocols [@daggitt2023routing]

The development of `agda-stdlib` has also had a synergistic relationship with that of Agda itself, helping to both test and motivate new language features.
For example, Agda supports a wide range of incompatible language extensions and `agda-stdlib` is designed modularly in order to be compatible with many different combinations of extensions.
Modules then request the minimal expressive power needed.
To facilitate this, Agda's extensions were categorised as "infective", "coinfective" or "neither", where
"infective" options impact all the import*ing* modules and "coinfective" options impact the import*ed* modules.
The library has also acted as a test bed for different approaches to defining co-inductive data types in Agda.

# Design Challenges

Organising libraries of discrete mathematics and algebra coherently is notoriously difficult
[@carette2020leveraging] [@cohen2020hierarchy].
There is a tension between being as general as possible and providing direct and intuitive definitions.
Mathematical objects often permit multiple representations with different advantages -- but this leads to redundancy/duplication.
Some ITPs ([@coq2024manual], [@paulson1994isabelle]) have a rich ecosystem of external libraries, avoiding canonical definitions at the risk of incompatibilities between libraries.
We have chosen, like Lean's `mathlib` [@van2020maintaining], to provide a repository of canonical definitions.

`agda-stdlib` has embraced the "intrinsic style" of dependent types, where data structures themselves contain correctness invariants.
For instance, rational numbers include a proof that the numerator and denominator have no common factors and decision procedures return proofs rather than booleans.
We believe that `agda-stdlib` has been one of the first ITP standard libraries to tackle this challenge.

The library has also embraced Agda's parametrised modules to facilitate polymorphism [@ivardeBruin2023].
This contrasts with other functional languages which often rely on type classes for similar functionality.
This lets users specify in a single location how to instantiate the abstract parameters in the module and reduces the overhead of instance search.
A drawback is imports must be qualified when instantiating code multiple times in the same scope.
The library also uses parameterised modules to safely and scalably embed non-constructive mathematics into a constructive library.

# Testing

Correctness proofs do not remove the need for testing performance and features that cannot be reasoned about internally (such the FFI and macros).
However, the test suite's coverage is incomplete as this is not a priority for the community.

# Notable improvements in version 2.0

Version 2.0 of `agda-stdlib` [@agda-stdlib-v2.0] has attempted to address some of the design flaws and missing functionality of previous versions, including:

- Minimised Dependency Graphs: core modules rely on fewer parts of the library, resulting in faster load and compilation times in general.

- Standardisation: objects such as groups, rings etc., and their morphisms are now constructed uniformly, enhancing consistency and usability.

- Tactics Library: expanded the list of available tactics, although experiments suggest performance can be improved.

- Testing Framework: introduced a golden testing framework to let users write their own test suites.
