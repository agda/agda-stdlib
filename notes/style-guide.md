Style guide for the standard library
====================================

This is very much a work-in-progress and is not exhaustive. Furthermore many of
these are aspirations, and may be violated in certain parts of the library.
It is hoped that at some point a linter will be developed for Agda which will
automate most of this.

## File structure

#### Indentation

* The contents of a top-level module should have zero indentation.

* Every subsequent nested scope should then be indented by an additional
  two spaces.

* `where` blocks should be indented by two spaces and their contents
  should be aligned with the `where`.

* If the type of a term does not fit on one line then the subsequent
  lines of the type should all be aligned with the first character
  of the first line of type, e.g.
  ```agda
  map-cong₂ : ∀ {a b} {A : Set a} {B : Set b} →
              ∀ {f g : A → B} {xs} →
              All (λ x → f x ≡ g x) xs → map f xs ≡ map g xs
  ```

* As can be seen in the example above, function arrows at line breaks
  should always go at the end of the line rather than the beginning of the
  next line.

#### Modules

* As a rule of thumb there should only be one named module per file. Anonymous
  modules are fine, but named internal modules should either be opened publicly
  immediately or split out into a separate file.

* Module parameters should be put on a single line if they fit.

* Otherwise they should be spread out over multiple lines, each indented by two
  spaces. If they can be grouped logically by line then it is fine to do so,
  otherwise, a line each is probably clearest. The `where` keyword should be placed
  on an  additional line of code at the end. For example:
  ```agda
  module Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Base.Single
    {a ℓ} {A : Set a} (_∼_ : Rel A ℓ)
    (refl : Reflexive _∼_) (trans : Transitive _∼_)
    where
  ```

* There should always be a single blank line after a module declaration.

#### Imports

* All imports should be placed in a list at the top of the file
  immediately after the module declaration.

* The list of imports should be declared in alphabetical order.

* If the module takes parameters that require imports from other files,
  then those imports only may be placed above the module declaration, e.g.
  ```agda
  open import Algebra using (Ring)

  module Algebra.Properties.Ring {a l} (ring : Ring a l) where

        ... other imports
  ```

* If it is important that certain names only come into scope later in
  the file then the module should still be imported at the top of the
  file but it can be given a shorter name using the keyword `as` and then
  opened later on in the file when needed, e.g.
  ```agda
  import Data.List.Relation.Binary.Equality.Setoid as SetoidEquality
  ...
  ...
  open SetoidEquality S
  ```

* When using only a few items (i.e. < 5) from a module, it is a good practice to
  enumerate the items that will be used by declaring the import statement
  with the directive `using`. This makes the dependencies clearer, e.g.
  ```agda
  open import Data.Nat.Properties using (+-assoc)
  ```

* Re-exporting terms from a module using the `public` modifier
  should *not* be done in the list of imports as it is very hard to spot.
  Instead the best approach is often to rename the import and then open it
  publicly later in the file in a more obvious fashion, e.g.
  ```agda
  -- Import list
  ...
  import Data.Nat.Properties as NatProperties
  ...

  -- Re-export ring
  open NatProperties public
    using (+-*-ring)
  ```

* If multiple import modifiers are used, then they should occur in the
  following order: `public`, `using` `renaming`, and if `public` is used
  then the `using` and `renaming` modifiers should occur on a separate line.
  For example:
  ```agda
  open Monoid monoid public
    using (ε) renaming (_∙_ to _+_)
  ```

#### Layout of data declarations

* The `:` for each constructor should be aligned.

#### Layout of record declarations

* The `:` for each field should be aligned.

* If defining multiple records back to back then there should be a double
  empty line between each record.

#### Layout of record instances

* The `record` keyword should go on the same line as the rest of the proof.

* The next line with the first record item should start with a single `{`.

* Every subsequent item of the record should go on its own line starting with
  a `;`.

* The final line should end with `}` on its own.

* The `=` signs for each field should be aligned.

* For example:
  ```agda
  ≤-isPreorder : IsPreorder _≡_ _≤_
  ≤-isPreorder = record
    { isEquivalence = isEquivalence
    ; reflexive     = ≤-reflexive
    ; trans         = ≤-trans
    }
  ```

#### Layout of `where` blocks

* `where` blocks are preferred rather than the `let` construction.

* The `where` keyword should be placed on the line below the main proof,
  indented by two spaces.

* If the content of the block is non-trivial then types should be
  provided alongside the terms, and all terms should be on lines after
  the `where`, e.g.
  ```agda
  statement : Statement
  statement = proof
    where
    proof : Proof
    proof = some-very-long-proof
  ```

* If the content of the block is trivial or is an `open` statement then
  it can be provided on the same line as the `where` and a type can be
  omitted, e.g.
  ```agda
  statement : Statement
  statement = proof
    where proof = x
  ```

#### Layout of equational reasoning

* The `begin` clause should go on the same line as the rest of the proof.

* Every subsequent combinator `_≡⟨_⟩_` should be placed on an additional
line of code, indented by two spaces.

* The relation sign (e.g. `≡`) for each line should be aligned if possible.

* For example:
  ```agda
  +-comm : Commutative _+_
  +-comm zero    n = sym (+-identityʳ n)
  +-comm (suc m) n = begin
    suc m + n    ≡⟨⟩
    suc (m + n)  ≡⟨ cong suc (+-comm m n) ⟩
    suc (n + m)  ≡⟨ sym (+-suc n m) ⟩
    n + suc m    ∎
  ```

* When multiple reasoning frameworks need to be used in the same file, the
  `open` statement should always come in a where clause local to the
  definition. This way users can easily see which reasoning toolkit is
  being used. For instance:
  ```agda
  foo m n p = begin
    (...) ∎
    where open ≤-Reasoning
  ```

#### Mutual and private blocks

* Non-trivial proofs in `private` blocks are generally discouraged. If it is
  non-trivial, then chances are that someone will want to reuse it at some
  point!

* Instead private blocks should only be used to prevent temporary terms and
  records that are defined for convenience from being exported by the module.

* The mutual block is considered obselete. Please use the standard approach
  of placing the type signatures of the mutually recursive functions before
  their definitions.

#### Function arguments

* Function arguments should be aligned between cases where possible, e.g.
  ```agda
  +-comm : Commutative _+_
  +-comm zero    n = ...
  +-comm (suc m) n = ...
  ```

* If an argument is unused in a case, it may at the author's
  discretion be replaced by an underscore, e.g.
  ```agda
  +-assoc : Associative _+_
  +-assoc zero    _ _ = refl
  +-assoc (suc m) n o = cong suc (+-assoc m n o)
  ```

* If it is necessary to refer to an implicit argument in one case then
  the implicit argument brackets must be included in every other case as
  well, e.g.
  ```agda
  m≤n⇒m∸n≡0 : ∀ {m n} → m ≤ n → m ∸ n ≡ 0
  m≤n⇒m∸n≡0 {n = n} z≤n       = 0∸n≡0 n
  m≤n⇒m∸n≡0 {n = _} (s≤s m≤n) = m≤n⇒m∸n≡0 m≤n
  ```

* As of Agda 2.6.0 dot patterns are no longer necessary when unifying
  function arguments and therefore should not be prepended to function
  arguments.

#### Other

* The `with` syntax is preferred over the use of `case` from the `Function`
  module.

* The standard library uses a standard line length of 72 characters. Please
  try to stay within this limit. Having said that this is the most violated
  rule in the style-guide and it is recognised that it is not always possible
  to achieve whilst maintaining meaningful names.

## Types

#### Implicit and explicit arguments

* Function arguments should be implicit if they can "almost always"
  be inferred. If there are common cases where they cannot be inferred
  then they should be left explicit.

* If there are lots of implicit arguments that are common to a collection
  of proofs they should be extracted by using an anonymous module.

* Implicit of type `Level` and `Set` can be generalized using the keyword
  `variable`. At the moment the policy is *not* to generalize over any other
  types to minimize the amount of information that users have to keep in
  their head concurrently.

## Naming conventions

* Names should be descriptive - i.e. given the name of a proof and the
  module it lives in, then users should be able to make a reasonable
  guess at its meaning.

* Terms from other modules should only be renamed to avoid name clashes,
  otherwise, all names should be used as defined.

* Datatype names should be capitalized, being its first letter in uppercase
and the remaining letters in lowercase.

* Function names should follow the camelCase naming convention, in which each
word within a compound word is capitalized except for the first word.

#### Variables

* Sets are named `A`, `B`, `C` etc.

* Predicates are named `P`, `Q`, `R` etc.

* Relations are named either `R`, `S`, `T` in the general case
  or `_≈_`/`_∼_`/`_≤_`/`_<_` if they are known to be an
  equivalence/preorder/partial order/strict partial order.

* Level variables are typically chosen to match the name of the
  relation, e.g. `a` for the level of a set `A`, `p` for a predicate
  `P`. By convention the name `0ℓ` is preferred over `zero` for the
  zeroth level.

* Natural variables are named `m`, `n`, `o`, ... (default `n`)

* Integer variables are named `i`, `j`, `k`, ... (default `i`)

* Rational variables are named `p`, `q`, `r`, ... (default `p`)

* All other variables tend to be named `x`, `y`, `z`.

* Collections of elements are usually indicated by appending an `s`
  (e.g. if you are naming your variables `x` and `y` then lists
  should be named `xs` and `ys`).

#### Preconditions and postconditions

* Preconditions should only be included in names of results if
  "important" (mostly a judgment call).

* Preconditions of results should be prepended to a description
  of the result by using the symbol `⇒` in names (e.g. `asym⇒antisym`)

* Preconditions and postconditions should be combined using the symbols
  `∨` and `∧` (e.g. `m*n≡0⇒m≡0∨n≡0`)

* Try to avoid the need for bracketing, but if necessary use square
  brackets (e.g. `[m∸n]⊓[n∸m]≡0`)

* When naming proofs, the variables should occur in alphabetical order,
  e.g. `m≤n+m` rather than `n≤m+n`.

#### Operators and relations

* Concrete operators and relations should be defined using
  [mixfix](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/mixfix-operators.html)
  notation where applicable (e.g. `_+_`, `_<_`)

* Common properties such as those in rings/orders/equivalences etc.
  have defined abbreviations (e.g. commutativity is shortened to `comm`).
  `Data.Nat.Properties` is a good place to look for examples.

* Properties should be prefixed by the relevant operator/relation and
  separated from its name by a hyphen `-` (e.g. commutativity of sum
  results in a compositional name `+-comm` where `-` acts as a separator).

* If the relevant Unicode characters are available, negated forms of
  relations should be used over the `¬` symbol (e.g. `m+n≮n` should be
  used instead of `¬m+n<n`).

#### Functions and relations over specific datatypes

* When defining a new relation `P` over a datatype `X` in `Data.X.Relation` module
  it is often common to  define how to introduce and eliminate that relation
  with respect to various functions. Suppose you have a function `f`, then
  - `f⁺` is a lemma of the form `Precondition -> P(f)`
  - `f⁻` is a lemma of the form `P(f) -> Postcondition`
  The logic behind the name is that ⁺ makes f appear in the conclusion while
  makes it disappear from the hypothesis.

  For example in `Data.List.Relation.Binary.Pointwise` we have `map⁺` to show
  how the `map` function may be introduced and `map⁻` to show how it may be
  eliminated:
  ```agda
  map⁺ : Pointwise (λ a b → R (f a) (g b)) as bs → Pointwise R (map f as) (map g bs)
  map⁻ : Pointwise R (map f as) (map g bs) → Pointwise (λ a b → R (f a) (g b)) as bs
  ```

#### Keywords

* If the name of something clashes with a keyword in Agda, then convention
  is to place angular brackets around the name, e.g. `⟨set⟩` and `⟨module⟩`.
