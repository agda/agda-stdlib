When releasing a new version of Agda standard library, the following
procedure can be followed:

* Update README.agda:

  ** Replace 'development version' by 'version X.Y' in the title.

  ** After the list of authors, replace

     -- The development version of the library often requires the latest
     -- development version of Agda.

     by

     -- This version of the library has been tested using Agda A.B.C.

* Update the lib.cabal version to X.Y.

* Ensure that the library type-checks using Agda A.B.C:

    make test

* If necessary, copy the contents of notes/future-version.txt to
  CHANGELOG. Remove the contents from notes/future-version.txt

* Finish the CHANGELOG.

* Update the copyright year range in the LICENSE file, if necessary.

* Tag version X.Y (do not forget to record the changes above first):

    VERSION=X.Y
    git tag -a v$VERSION -m "Agda standard library version $VERSION"

* Removed release-specific information from README.agda.

* Add a new header to CHANGELOG (do not forget to record the changes).

* Push all the changes and the new tag (requires Git >= 1.8.3):

    git push --follow-tags

* Update submodule commit for the stable library in Agda:

    cd agda
    make fast-forward-std-lib

  Record the changes and push

* Submit a pull request to update the version of standard library on Homebrew (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/agda.rb)

* Update the Agda wiki:

  ** The standard library page.

  ** News section on the main page.

* Announce the release of the new version on the Agda mailing lists
  (users and developers).
