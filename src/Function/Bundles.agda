-- The contents of this file should usually be accessed from `Function`.

-- Note that these bundles differ from those found elsewhere in other
-- library hierarchies as they take Setoids as parameters. This is
-- because a function is of no use without knowing what its domain and
-- codomain is, as well which equalities are being considered over them.
-- One consequence of this is that they are not built from the
-- definitions found in `Function.Structures` as is usually the case in
-- other library hierarchies, as this would duplicate the equality
-- axioms.

-- Other

  -- A left inverse is also known as a “split surjection”.
  --
  -- As the name implies, a split surjection is a special kind of
  -- surjection where the witness generated in the domain in the
  -- function for elements `x₁` and `x₂` are equal if `x₁ ≈ x₂` .
  --
  -- The difference is the `from-cong` law --- generally, the section
  -- (called `Surjection.from` or `SplitSurjection.from`) of a surjection
  -- need not respect equality, whereas it must in a split surjection.
  --
  -- The two notions coincide when the equivalence relation on `B` is
  -- propositional equality (because all functions respect propositional
  -- equality).
  --
  -- For further background on (split) surjections, one may consult any
  -- general mathematical references which work without the principle
  -- of choice. For example:
  --
  --   https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/split+epimorphism.
  --
  -- The connection to set-theoretic notions with the same names is
  -- justified by the setoid type theory/homotopy type theory
  -- observation/definition that (∃x : A. P) = ∥ Σx : A. P ∥ --- i.e.,
  -- we can read set-theoretic ∃ as squashed/propositionally truncated Σ.
  --
  -- We see working with setoids as working in the MLTT model of a setoid
  -- type theory, in which ∥ X ∥ is interpreted as the setoid with carrier
  -- set X and the equivalence relation that relates all elements.
  -- All maps into ∥ X ∥ respect equality, so in the idiomatic definitions
  -- here, we drop the corresponding trivial `cong` field completely.
