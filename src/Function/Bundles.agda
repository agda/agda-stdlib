-- The Agda standard library
--
-- Bundles for types of functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The contents of this file should usually be accessed from `Function`.

-- Note that these bundles differ from those found elsewhere in other
-- library hierarchies as they take Setoids as parameters. This is
-- because a function is of no use without knowing what its domain and
-- codomain is, as well which equalities are being considered over them.
-- One consequence of this is that they are not built from the
-- definitions found in `Function.Structures` as is usually the case in
-- other library hierarchies, as this would duplicate the equality
-- axioms.
