-- Definitions

-- Box

-- We start with the definition of □ ("box") which is named after the box
-- modality in modal logic. `□ T x` states that all the elements one step
-- away from `x` with respect to the relation R satisfy `T`.

□ : ∀ {t} → Pred A t → Pred A (a ⊔ b ⊔ t)
□ T x = ∀ {y} → R x y → T y

-- Use cases of □ include:
-- * The definition of the accessibility predicate corresponding to R:
--   data Acc (x : A) : Set (a ⊔ b) where
--     step : □ Acc x → Acc x

-- * The characterization of stability under weakening: picking R to be
--   `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Inductive`, `∀ {Γ} → Tm Γ → □ T Γ`
--   corresponds to the fact that we have a notion of weakening for `Tm`.

-- Diamond

-- We then have the definition of ◇ ("diamond") which is named after the
-- diamond modality in modal logic. In modal logic, `◇ T x` states that
-- there exists an element one step away from x with respect to the
-- relation R that satisfies T. It is worth noting that the modal logic
-- metaphor breaks down here: this only is a closure operator if the step
-- we take is *backwards* with respect to R.

◇ : ∀ {t} → Pred A t → Pred A (a ⊔ b ⊔ t)
◇ T x = Σ[ support ∈ A ] (R support x × T support)

-- Use cases of ◇ include:
-- * The characterization of strengthening: picking R to be
--   `Data.List.Relation.Sublist.Inductive`, `∀ {Γ} → Tm Γ → ◇ Tm Γ`
--   is the type of a function strengthening a term to its support:
--   all the unused variables are discarded early on by the `related`
--   proof.
-- Cf. Conor McBride's "Everybody's got to be somewhere" for a more
-- detailed treatment of such an example.

-- Closed

-- Whenever we have a value in one context, we can get one in any
-- related context.
