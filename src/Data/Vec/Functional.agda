-- The Agda standard library

-- Vectors defined as functions from a finite set to a type.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This implementation is designed for reasoning about fixed-size
-- vectors where ease of retrieval of elements is prioritised.

-- See `Data.Vec` for an alternative implementation using inductive
-- data-types, which is more suitable for reasoning about vectors that
-- will grow or shrink in size.
