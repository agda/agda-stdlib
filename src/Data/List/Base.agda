-- Operations for filtering lists

-- The following are a variety of functions that can be used to
-- construct sublists using a predicate.
--
-- Each function has two forms. The first main variant uses a
-- proof-relevant decidable predicate, while the second variant uses
-- a irrelevant boolean predicate and are suffixed with a `ᵇ` character,
-- typed as \^b.
--
-- The decidable versions have several advantages: 1) easier to prove
-- properties, 2) better meta-variable inference and 3) most of the rest
-- of the library is set-up to work with decidable predicates. However,
-- in rare cases the boolean versions can be useful, mainly when one
-- wants to minimise dependencies.
--
-- In summary, in most cases you probably want to use the decidable
-- versions over the boolean versions, e.g. use `takeWhile (_≤? 10) xs`
-- rather than `takeWhileᵇ (_≤ᵇ 10) xs`.
