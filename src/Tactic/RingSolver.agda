-- Use this macro when you want to solve something *under* a lambda. For example:
-- say you have a long proof, and you just want the solver to deal with an
-- intermediate step. Call it like so:
--
--   lemma₃ : ∀ x y → x + y * 1 + 3 ≈ 2 + 1 + y + x
--   lemma₃ x y = begin
--     x + y * 1 + 3 ≈⟨ +-comm x (y * 1) ⟨ +-cong ⟩ refl ⟩
--     y * 1 + x + 3 ≈⟨ solve (x ∷ y ∷ []) Int.ring ⟩
--     3 + y + x     ≡⟨ refl ⟩
--     2 + 1 + y + x ∎
--
-- The first argument is the free variables, and the second is the
-- ring implementation (as before).
--
-- One thing to note here is that we need to be able to infer *both* sides of
-- the equality, which the normal equaltional reasoning combinators don't let you
-- do. You'll need the combinators defined in Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Inference.
-- These are just as powerful as the others, but have slightly better inference properties.
