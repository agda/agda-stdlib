--   lemma₃ x y = begin
--     x + y * 1 + 3 ≈⟨ +-comm x (y * 1) ⟨ +-cong ⟩ refl ⟩

-- The first argument is the free variables, and the second is the

-- One thing to note here is that we need to be able to infer *both* sides of
-- the equality, which the normal equaltional reasoning combinators don't let you
-- do. You'll need the combinators defined in Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Inference.
-- These are just as powerful as the others, but have slightly better inference properties.
