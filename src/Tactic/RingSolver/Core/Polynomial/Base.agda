-- Sparse polynomials in a commutative ring, encoded in Horner normal
-- form.
--
-- Horner normal form encodes a polynomial as a list of coefficients.
-- As an example take the polynomial:
--
--   3 + 2x² + 4x⁵ + 2x⁷
--
-- Then expand it out, filling in the missing coefficients:
--
--   3x⁰ + 0x¹ + 2x² + 0x³ + 0x⁴ + 4x⁵ + 0x⁶ + 2x⁷
--
-- And then encode that as a list:
--
--   [3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2]
--
-- The representation we use here is optimised from the above. First,
-- we remove the zero terms, and add a "gap" index next to every
-- coefficient:
--
--   [(3,0),(2,1),(4,2),(2,1)]
--
-- Which can be thought of as a representation of the expression:
--
--   x⁰ * (3 + x * x¹ * (2 + x * x² * (4 + x * x¹ * (2 + x * 0))))
--
-- This is "sparse" Horner normal form.
--
-- The second optimisation deals with representing multiple variables
-- in a polynomial. The standard trick is to encode a polynomial in n
-- variables as a polynomial with coefficients in n-1 variables,
-- recursing until you hit 0 which is simply the type of the coefficient
-- itself.
--
-- We again encode "gaps" here, with the injection index. Since the
-- number of variables in a polynomial is contained in its type,
-- however, operations on this gap are type-relevant, so it's not
-- convenient to simply use ℕ. We use _≤′_ instead.

-- Addition

-- The reason the following code is so verbose is termination

-- (on ℕ.compare p q):
--
-- ⊞-coeffs ((x , p) ∷ xs) ((y , q) ∷ ys) with (ℕ.compare p q)
-- ... | ℕ.less    p k = (x , p) ∷ ⊞-coeffs xs ((y , k) ∷ ys)

-- ... | ℕ.greater q k = (y , q) ∷ ⊞-coeffs ((x , k) ∷ xs) ys
--
-- However, because the first and third recursive calls each rewrap
-- a list that was already pattern-matched on, the recursive call
-- does not strictly decrease the size of its argument.
--
-- Interestingly, if --without-K is turned off, we don't need
-- the helper function ⊞-coeffs; we could pattern match on _⊞_ directly.
